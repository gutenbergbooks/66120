<h3>
PREFACE.
</h3>

<p>
From the historical and descriptive nature of
the following tale, the Author intended that
certain passages should be illustrated with notes,
containing the local traditions and authorities
from which it has been derived; but on second
thoughts he has preferred confining these
explanations to the preface.
</p>

<p>
History will have rendered familiar to the
reader the names of many who bear a prominent
part in the career of <i>Walter Fenton</i>; but there
are other characters of minor importance, who,
though less known to fame than Dundee and
Dunbarton, were beings who really lived and
breathed, and acted a part in the great drama of
those days.  Among these, we may particularise
Douglas, of Finland, and Annie Laurie.
</p>

<p>
This lady was one of the four daughters of Sir
Robert Laurie, the first Baronet of Maxwelton,
and it was to her that Finland inscribed those
well-known verses, and that little air which now
bear her name, and are so wonderfully plaintive
and chaste for the time; but it is painful to record
that, notwithstanding all the ardour and devotion
of her lover, the fair Annie was wedded as
described in the romance.  Her father, Sir Robert,
was created a baronet in 1685.
</p>

<p>
The Old Halberdier and Hugh Blair (mentioned
so frequently) are also real characters.
The former distinguished himself at the battle of
Sedgemoor, and by a <i>Royal Order</i>, dated 26th
February, 1686, received "forty pounds for his
good service in firing the great guns against the
rebells" who were opposed to Sir James Halkett's
Royal Scots.  The tavern of Hugh Blair was long
celebrated in Edinburgh.  His name will be
found in <i>Blackadder's Memoirs</i>, and frequently
among the <i>Decisions</i> of Lord Fountainhall, in
disputes concerning various runlets of Frontiniac, &amp;c.
</p>

<p>
Lord Mersington was exactly the personage he
is described in the following pages&mdash;an unprincipled
sot.  From <i>Cruickshank's History</i> it appears
that his lady was banished the liberties of
Edinburgh in 1674, for being engaged in the female
assembly which insulted Archbishop Sharpe.
</p>

<p>
Of Thomas Butler, an unfortunate Irish
gentleman connected with the ducal house of Ormond,
who bears a prominent part in Volume III., an
account will be found in the London Papers of
1720, in which year he was executed at Tyburn
as a highwayman.
</p>

<p>
The song mentioned so frequently, and the
burden of which is <i>Lillibulero bullen a la!</i> was a
favorite whig ditty, and the chorus was formed by
the pass-words used during the Irish massacre of
1641.
</p>

<p>
The principal locality of the story is the
Wrightshouse or Castle of Bruntisfield, which
stood near the Burghmuir of Edinburgh, and was
unwisely removed in 1800, to make way for that
hideous erection&mdash;the hospital of Gillespie.  As
described in the romance, it was a magnificent
chateau in the old Scoto-French style of architecture,
and was completely encrusted with legends,
devices, armorial bearings, and quaint bassi
relievi.
</p>

<p>
It was of great antiquity, and over the central
door were the arms of Britain, with the initials
J. VI. M. B. F. E. H. R.
</p>

<p>
Amid a singular profusion of sculptured figures
representing Hope, Faith, Charity, &amp;c., was a
bas-relief of Adam and Eve in Eden, bearing the
following legend:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Quhen Adam delvd and Eve span<br />
  Quhar war a' the gentiles than?<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Between them was a female representing Taste,
and inscribed <i>Gustus</i>.  "On the eastern front
of the castle was sculptured a head of Julius
Cæsar, and under it <i>Caius Jul. Cæsar, primus
Rom. Imp</i>.  On the eastern wing were figures of
Temperentia, Prudentia, and Justitia, which it is
remarkable were among the first stones thrown
down."  (<i>Scots Mag.</i>, 1800.)  On the west wing
was a Roman head of Octavius II., and five
representations of the Virtues, beautifully sculptured.
<i>Sicut oliva fructifera</i> 1376, <i>In Domino Confido</i>,
1400, <i>Patriæ et Posteris</i>, and many other valuable
carvings, which are now preserved at Woodhouselee,
adorned the walls and windows.
</p>

<p>
The east wing was said to have been built by
Robert III.; <i>Arnot</i> informs us, that the centre
was erected by James IV. for one of his mistresses,
and about the close of the last century, Hamilton
of Barganie made many additions to it.  How the
edifice obtained the name of <i>Wright's</i> or<i> Wryte's-house</i>
is now unknown, as no proprietor of it who
bore that name can now be traced; but the
Napiers appear to have possessed the barony from an
early period, and their names frequently occur in
local records.
</p>

<p>
Alexander Napier de Wrichtyshouse appears as
one of an inquest in 1488.  His coat-armorial was
a bend charged with a crescent, between two
mullets.  He married Margaret Napier of Merchiston,
whose father was slain at the battle of Flodden.
In 1581, among the commissioners appointed by
James VI., "anent the cuinze," we find William
Napier of the Wrightshouse, (<i>Acta Parliamentorum</i>)
and in 1590, Barbara Napier, his sister,
was convicted of sorcery, for which on the llth of
May she was sentenced to be burnt at a "stake
sett on the Castellhill, with barrels, coales, heather,
and powder;" but when the torch was about to be
applied, pregnancy was alleged, and the execution
delayed.  (<i>Calderwood's Historic.</i>)
</p>

<p>
In 1632, William of the Wrightshouse was a
commissioner at Holyrood, anent the valuation of
Tiends ; and two years after we find him retoured
heir to his father William in certain lands in
Berwickshire; but in 1626, "<i>terrarum de Brounisfield,
infra parochiam de Sanct. Cuthbert</i>" belonged to
Sir William Fairlie of Braid.  In 1649 he obtained
a crown charter of his lands (<i>MS. Mag. Sigilli</i>),
and in 1680, the last notice of this old family will
be found in the <i>Inquisitionum Retornatarum</i>, where
it ends in a female.
</p>

<p>
Thus about the close of the 17th century, the
Napiers had passed away, and their barony was
possessed by the Laird of Pennicuick.  All that
now remains of them is their burial place on the
north side of St. Giles' Cathedral, where may still
be seen their mouldering coat-armorial, with this
inscription:&mdash;

CHAPTER I.
<br /><br />
THE PLACE OF BRUNTISFIELD.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  There is nae Covenant noo, Lassie,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nae covenant, noo;<br />
  The solemn league and covenant,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are a' broken through.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OLD SONG.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
One evening in the month of March, 1688, a
party of thirty soldiers mustered rapidly and
silently under the arches of the White Horse
Hostel, an old and well-known inn on the north
side of the Canongate of Edinburgh.  The night
was dark and cold, and a high wind swept in gusts
down the narrow way between the picturesque
houses of that venerable street and the steep side
of the bare and rocky Calton-hill.
</p>

<p>
Gathering in cautious silence, the soldiers
scarcely permitted the butts of their heavy
matchlocks to touch the pavement: in a loud whisper
the officer gave the order to march, and they
moved off with the same air of quietness and
rapidity which characterized their muster, and
showed that a very secret or important duty was
about to be executed.
</p>

<p>
In those days the ranks were drawn up three
deep, and such was the mode until a later period;
so, by simply facing a body of men to the right or
left, they found themselves three abreast without
confusion or delay.
</p>

<p>
"Fenton," said the officer to a young man who
carried a pike beside him, "keep rearward.  You
are wont to have the eye of a hawk; and if any
impertinent citizen appears to watch us, lay thy
truncheon across his pate."
</p>

<p>
This injunction was unnecessary; for those
belated citizens who saw them, hurried past, glad
to escape unquestioned.  In those days, when
every corporal of horse or foot, was vested with
more judicial powers than the Lord Justice
General, the night march of a band of soldiers was
studiously to be avoided.  Aware that some
"deed of persecution" was about to be acted, the
occasional wayfarers hurried on, or turned
altogether aside, when forewarned that soldiers
appeared, by the measured tread of feet, by the
gleam of a gun-barrel, or cone of a helmet glinting
in the rays of light that shot from half-closed
windows into the palpable darkness.
</p>

<p>
These soldiers belonged to the regiment of
George Earl of Dunbarton, the oldest in the
Scottish army, and a body of such antiquity, that
they were jocularly known in France as Pontius
Pilate's Guards.  With red coats, they wore
morions of black unpolished iron; breast-plates
of the same metal, crossed by buff belts which
sustained their swords, fixing-daggers and collars
of bandoleers, as the twelve little wooden cases,
each containing a charge of powder, were named.
Their breeches and stockings were of bright
scarlet, and each had a long musket sloped on his
shoulder, with its lighted match gleaming like a
glowworm in the dark.  The officer was
distinguished by a plume that waved from a tube on
his gilded helmet, which, like his gorget, was of
polished steel, while to denote his rank he carried
a half-pike, in addition to his rapier and dagger,
and wore a black corslet richly engraved and
studded with nails of gold, conform to the Royal
Order of 1686.  He was a handsome fellow, tall,
and well set up, with a heavy dark mustache,
and a face like each of his soldiers, well bronzed
by the sun of France and Tangiers.
</p>

<p>
In that age, the closes and wynds of the Scottish
capital were like those of ancient Paris or
modern Lisbon, narrow, smoky, and crowded,
unpaved, unlighted, and encumbered with heaps
of rubbish and mud, which obstructed the gutters
and lay in fœtid piles, until heavy rains swept all
the debris of the city down from its lofty ridge
into the Loch on the north, or the ancient
<i>communis ma</i>, on the south.  At night the careful
citizen carried a lantern&mdash;the bold one his sword;
for men generally walked abroad well armed, and
none ever rode without a pair of long iron pistols
at his saddle-bow.
</p>

<p>
The late king had made every kind of dissipation
fashionable; and after night-fall the gallants
of the city swaggered about the Craimes or the
Abbey-Close, muffled in their cloaks like
conspirators; and despite the axes of the city guard,
and the halberds of the provost, excesses were
committed hourly; and seldom a night passed
without the clash of rapiers and the shouts of
cavalier brawlers being heard ringing in the dark
thoroughfares of the city.  Thieves were hanged,
coiners were quartered, covenanters beheaded, and
witches burned, until executions failed to excite
either interest or horror; but with the plumed
and buff-booted Ruffler of the day, who brawled
and fought from a sheer love of mischief and
wine, what plebeian baillie or pumpkin-headed
city-guard would have dared to find fault?  Of
this more anon.
</p>

<p>
Stumbling through the dark streets, the party
of soldiers marched past the Pleasance Porte,
above the arch of which grinned a white row of
five bare skulls, which had been bleaching there
since 1681.  Every barrier of Edinburgh was
garnished with these terrible trophies of
maladministration.
</p>

<p>
Leaving behind them the ancient suburb, they
diverged upon the road near the old ruined convent
of St. Mary of Placentia, which, from the hill of
St. Leonard, reared up its ivied walls in shattered
outline.  Beyond, and towering up abruptly from
the lonely glen below, frowned the tremendous
front of Salisbury craigs.  The rising moon showed
its broad and shining disc, red and fiery above
their black rocks, and fitfully between the
hurrying clouds, its rays streamed down the Hauze, a
deep and ghastly defile, formed by some mighty
convulsion of nature, when these vast craigs had
been rent from that ridgy mountain, where King
Arthur sat of old, and watched his distant gallies
on the waters of the Roman Bodoria.
</p>

<p>
For a moment the moonlight streamed down
the defile, on the hill of St. Leonard, with its
thatched cottages and ruined convent, on the
glancing armour of the soldiers, and the bare trees
bordering the highway; again the passing clouds
enveloped it in opaque masses, and all was darkness.
</p>

<p>
"Sergeant Wemyss," cried the cavalier officer,
breaking the silence which had till then been
observed.
</p>

<p>
"Here, an't please your honour," responded
the halberdier.
</p>

<p>
"Where tarries that loitering abbeylubber, who
was to have joined us on the march?"
</p>

<p>
"The Macer?"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, he with the council's warrant for this
dirty work."
</p>

<p>
"Yonder he stands, I believe, your honour, by
the ruins of the mass-monging days," replied the
sergeant, pointing to a figure which a passing gleam
of the moon revealed emerging from the ruins.
</p>

<p>
"Mean you that tall spunger in the red Rocquelaure?
To judge by his rapier and feather, he is a
gentleman, but one that seems to watch us.  So,
ho, sir! a good even; you are late abroad to-night."
</p>

<p>
"At your service, Sir," responded the other
gruffly behind the cape of his cloak, which, in the
fashion of an intriguing gallant of the day, he wore
so high up as completely to conceal his face.
</p>

<p>
"For King or for Covenant, Sir?" asked the
lieutenant, who was Richard Douglas, of Finland.
</p>

<p>
"Tush!" laughed the stranger; "this is an
old-fashioned test; you should have asked," he added,
in a lower voice, "For James VII., or William of
Orange! ha, hah!"
</p>

<p>
"Hush, my Lord Clermistonlee, by this light."
</p>

<p>
"Right, by Jove!" exclaimed the other, who
was considerably intoxicated.
</p>

<p>
"Body o' me! it ill beseems one of His Majesty's
Privy Councillors to be roving abroad thus
like a night hawk."
</p>

<p>
"I am the best judge of my own actions,
Mr. Douglas," replied the lord haughtily; but added
in a whisper, "you are bound for the Wrytes-house?"
</p>

<p>
"To the point, my Lord?" rejoined Douglas, drily.
</p>

<p>
"You will take particular care that the young
lady&mdash;tush, I mean the old one&mdash;they must not
escape, as you shall answer to the Council.  Dost
comprehend me&mdash;the young lady of Bruntisfield,
eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Too well, my Lord," replied the cavalier,
drawing himself up, and shaking his lofty plume
with undisguised hauteur.  "Curse on the libertine
fool!" he exclaimed to the young pikeman, as
he hurried after his party; "would he make me
his pimp?  By Heaven! he well deserves a slash
in the doublet for casting his eyes upon noble
ladies, as he would on the bona-robas of Merlin's
Wynd."
</p>

<p>
The young man's hand gradually sought the
hilt of his poniard.
</p>

<p>
"What said he, Finland?" he asked, with a
kindling eye and a reddening cheek.  "He spoke
of the Napiers, did he not?"
</p>

<p>
"Only to this purpose, that on peril of our
beards the ladies do not escape, especially the
younger one.  Hah! they say this ruffling libertine
hath long looked unutterable things at Lilian
Napier.  He is a deep intriguer, and the devil
only knows what plots he may be hatching now
against her."
</p>

<p>
"S'death!  Finland, assure me of this, and by
Heaven I will brain him with my partisan!"
</p>

<p>
"Hush, lad! these words are dangerous.  You
are but a young soldier yet, Walter," continued
the officer, laughing; "had you trailed a pike
under Henry de la Tour of Auvergne, and the old
Mareschal Crecqy, like me, you would ere this
have learned to value a girl's tears and a grandam's
groans at the same ransom, perhaps.  But, egad,
I had rather than my burganet full of broad
pieces, that this night's duty had fallen on any
other than myself; and I think, Major, the
Chevalier Drumquhazel (as we call him) might
have selected some of those old fellows whose
iron faces and iron hearts will bear them through
anything."
</p>

<p>
"Why, Finland," rejoined the pikeman, "you
are not wont to be backward!"
</p>

<p>
"Never when bullets or blades are to be
encountered; but to worry an old preacher, and
harry the house and barony of an ancient and
noble matron, by all the devils!  'tis not work for
men of honour.  The Napiers of Bruntisfield are
soothfast friends of the Lauries of Maxwelton&mdash;and
my dear little Annie&mdash;thou knowest, Walter,
that her wicked waggery will never let me hear
the end of it, if we march the Napiers to the
Tolbooth to-night."
</p>

<p>
"You see the advantage of being alone in this
bad and hollow-hearted world," said Fenton, in a
tone of bitterness, "of being uncaring and utterly
uncared for."
</p>

<p>
"Again in one of thy moody humours!"
</p>

<p>
"I have trailed this pike&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"True&mdash;since Sedgemoor-field was fought and
lost by Monmouth; but cheer up, my gallant.
If this rascal, William of Orange, unfurls his
banner among us, we will have battles and leaguers
enough; ay, faith! to which the Race of Dunbar,
and the Sack of Dundee, will be deemed but
child's-play.  And hark! for thy further
contentment, I trailed a partisan for four long years
under Turenne ere I obtained a pair of colours;
and <i>then</i> I thought my fortune made; but thou
see'st, Walter, I am only a poor lieutenant still.
Uncaring and uncared for!  Bravo! 'tis the frame
of mind to make an unscrupulous lad do his
<i>devoire</i> as becomes a soldier.  And yet I assure
thee, friend Walter, if aught in Scotland will
make a man swerve from his duty&mdash;ay, even old
Thomas Dalzel, that heart of steel&mdash;'tis the blue
eyes of Lilian Napier, of Bruntisfield.  The beauty
of her person is equalled only by the winning grace
of her manner; and I swear to thee, that not even
Mary of Charteris, or my own merry Annie, have
brighter charms&mdash;a redder lip, or a whiter hand.
Hast seen her, lad?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes," replied the young man with
vivacity, "a thousand times."
</p>

<p>
"And spoken to her?"
</p>

<p>
"Alas, no!" was the response, "not for these
past three years at least."
</p>

<p>
There was a sadness in his voice, which, with
the sigh accompanying his words, conveyed a
great deal&mdash;but only to the wind&mdash;for the gayer
cavalier marked it not.
</p>

<p>
"If we start the game&mdash;I mean these Dutch
renegades on the Napiers' barony&mdash;it will go hard
with them in these times, when every day brings
to light some new plot against the Government.
Napier of the Wrytes&mdash;'tis an old and honourable
line, and loth will I be to see it humbled."
</p>

<p>
"What can prompt ladies of honour to meddle
in matters of kirk or state?"
</p>

<p>
"The great father of confusion who usually
presides at the head of our Scottish affairs.  True,
Walter, the rock, the cod, and the bobbins
become them better; but I shall be sorry to
exact marching-money and free quarters from old
Lady Grizel.  Clermistonlee is the source of this
accusation, which alleges that her ladyship knows
of an intended invasion from Holland, and that
she hath reset two emissaries of the House of
Orange.  But a word in thine ear, Fenton; there
are villains at our Council-board who more richly
merit the cord of the Provost Marshal; and
Randal Clermont, of Clermistonlee, is not the least
undeserving of such exaltation."
</p>

<p>
"If the soldiers overhear, you are a lost man."
</p>

<p>
"God save King James and sain King Charles,
say I! but to old Mahoud with the Council, which
is driving the realm to ruin at full gallop.
Hah! here comes, at last, this loitering villain, the
macer," added Finland, as the moonlight revealed
a man running after them.  "Fellow! why the
deuce did you not meet us at the White Horse
Cellar?"
</p>

<p>
"Troth, Sir, just to tell ye the truth," replied
the panting functionary, drawing his gilt baton
from the pocket of his voluminous skirt, "it is
a kittle job this, and likely to get a puir man like
me unco ill will in such uncanny times&mdash;but I
stayed a wee while owre late may be, biding the
ale cogue, at Lucky Dreep's change-house in the
Kirk-o'-field Wynd.  However, Sir, follow me,
and we'll catch these traitors where the reiver
fand the tangs&mdash;at Madam's fire-side."
</p>

<p>
"Follow thee!" reiterated the cavalier officer,
contemptuously; "malediction on the hour when
a Douglas of Finland and a band of the old Scottish
Musqueteers are bent on the same errand with a
knave like thee!  Step out, my lads, and, Walter
Fenton, do thou fall rearward again, and see that
we are neither followed nor watched; for,
egad! these are times to sharpen one's wits."
</p>

<p>
Thus ordered, our hero (for such is the
handsome pikeman) fell gradually to the rear, and
stopped at times to bend his ear to the ground
and his eyes on the changing shadows of the
moonlit scenery; but he heard nothing save the
blustering wind of March, which swept through
the hollow dells, and saw only the shadows of the
flying clouds cast by the bright moon on the fields
through which the soldiers marched.
</p>

<p>
They had now passed all the houses of the city,
and were moving westward, by the banks of the
Burghloch, a broad and beautiful sheet of water,
upwards of a mile in length, shaded on one side
by the broken woods of Warrender and the old
orchards of the convent of Sienna; on the other,
open fields extended from its margin to the
embattled walls of the city.  One moment it shone
like a sheet of polished silver; the next it lay like
a lake of ink, as the passing clouds revealed or
obscured the full-orbed moon.
</p>

<p>
"What lights are those twinkling in the woods
yonder?" asked Finland, pointing northward with
his pike, on his party reaching the rhinns, or flat
at the end of the lake.
</p>

<p>
"The house of Coates, Sir&mdash;the old patrimony
of the Byres o' that Ilk."
</p>

<p>
"Harkee, macer, and the dark pile rising on
the height, further to the westward."
</p>

<p>
"The Place of Drumsheugh, Sir, pertaining of
auld to my Lord Clermistonlee.  He was just the
gudeman thereof before these kittle times.  A dark
and eerie place it is, where neither light has burned
nor fire bleezed&mdash;a joke been cracked nor a runlet
broached these mony lang years.  He is a dour
cheild that Clermistonlee, and one that would&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Twist thy hause, fellow," said the pikeman,
sternly, "for speaking of your betters otherwise
than with the reverence that becomes your
station."
</p>

<p>
"Ye craw brawly for the spawn o' an auld
covenanter," muttered the macer between his
teeth, as they entered the dark avenue that led to
the place of their destination; "brawly indeed! but
may-be I'll hae ye under my hands yet, for
a' your iron bravery and gay gauds."

CHAPTER II.
<br /><br />
THE PREACHER.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  A stranger, and a slave, unknown like him,<br />
  Proposing much means little;&mdash;talks and vows,<br />
  Delighted with the prospect of a change,<br />
  He promised to redeem ten Christians more,<br />
  And free us all from slavery.<br />

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
On the succession of James VII. to the throne,
the persecution of the covenanters by the civil
authorities, and by the troops under Dalzel,
Claverhouse, Lag, and officers of their selection, was
waged without pity or remorse, and the mad rage
which had disgraced the government of the
preceding reign, was still poured forth on the poor
peasantry, who were hunted from hill to wood,
and from moss to cavern, by the cavalry employed
in riding down the country, until by banishment,
imprisonment, famine, torture, the sword, and the
scaffold, presbyterianism was likely to be crushed
altogether; but an odium was raised, and a hatred
fostered, against the Scottish ministry of the
House of Stuart, which is yet felt keenly in the
pastoral districts, where the deeds of those days
are still spoken of with bitterness and reprehension.
</p>

<p>
The parliament of Scotland was presided over
by the Duke of Queensbury, a base time-server:
it appeared devoted to the new sovereign, and
declared him vested with solid and absolute
authority, in which none could participate, and had
promised him the whole array of the realm, between
the ages of sixteen and sixty, whenever he should
require their services.  Notwithstanding these
and similar loyal and liberal offers, there existed
a strong faction intensely averse to the rule of a
Catholic king; and though only three years before
Archibald, Earl of Argyle, and the equally
unfortunate Duke of Monmouth, had both perished in
a futile attempt to preserve the civil and religious
liberties of the land, the unsubdued Presbyterians
were still intriguing with Holland, and concerting
measures with William Prince of Orange, for a
descent on the British shores, the expulsion of
James by force of arms, and thus breaking the
legitimate succession of the Crown.  Suspicion of
these plots, and the intended invasion, had called
forth all the fury and tyranny of the Scottish
ministry against those whom they supposed to be
inimical to the then existing state of things.
</p>

<p>
A certain covenanting preacher of some celebrity,
the Reverend Mr. Ichabod Bummel, and a
man of a very different stamp, Captain Quentin
Napier, (an officer of the Scottish Brigade in the
service of the States-General,) both supposed to
be emissaries of the Prince of Orange, were
known to be concealed in the house of Bruntisfield,
the residence of Lady Grizel Napier, widow
of Sir Archibald of the Wrytes, a brave commander
of cavalier troops, who had fallen in the
Battle of Inverkeithing.  Unluckily for herself
the old lady was a kinswoman of the intercommuned
traitor, Patrick Hume, "umquhile designate
of Polworth," to use the legal and malevolent
phraseology of the day; and consequently,
notwithstanding the loyalty of her husband, the eyes
of that stern tribunal, which ruled the Scottish
Lowlands with a rod of iron, had been long upon
her.  And now, attended by a macer of Council,
bearing a warrant of search and arrest, a party
of soldiers were approaching her mansion.
</p>

<p>
An archway, the piers of which were surmounted
by two great stone eagles in full flight, each
bearing a lance aloft, gave admittance to the long
avenue that curved round the eminence on which
the mansion stood.  As the soldiers entered, the
measured tap of a distant drum was borne from
the city on the passing night-wind, and announced
the hour of ten.
</p>

<p>
Thick dark beeches and darker oaks waved
over them; the gigantic reliques of the great forest
of Drumsheugh, beneath whose shade in the days
of other years, the savage wolf, the stately elk,
the bristly boar, and the magnificent white bull
of ancient Caledonia, had roamed in all the glory
of unbounded freedom, on the site now occupied
by the Scottish capital.
</p>

<p>
The blustering wind of March swept through
their leafless branches, and whirled the last year's
leaves along the lonely and grass-grown avenue, a
turn of which brought the detachment at once in
front of the mansion.
</p>

<p>
The Wrytes-house, or Castle of Bruntisfield,
was a high and narrow edifice, built in that
striking and peculiar style of architecture which has
again become so common&mdash;the old Scottish.  It
was several stories in height, and had steep
corbie-stoned gables with little round turrets at
every angle, a lofty circular tower terminating in
a slated spire, numerous dormer windows, the
acute gablets of which were surmounted by
thistles, rosettes, crescents, and stars.  Every
casement was strongly grated, and the tall fantastic
outline of the mansion rose from the old
woodlands against the murky sky in a dark opaque
mass, as the soldiers passed the barbican gate,
and found themselves close to the oak-door, which
closed the central tower.
</p>

<p>
The night was still and dark; at times a red
star gleamed tremulously amid the flying vapour,
or a ray of moonlight cast a long and silvery line
of radiance across the beautiful sheet of water to
the eastward.  The turret-vanes, and old ancestral
oaks creaked mournfully in the rising wind,
and the venerable rooks that occupied their
summits croaked and screamed in concert.
</p>

<p>
"A noble old mansion!" said Walter Fenton;
"and if tradition says truly, was built by our
gallant James IV. for one of his frail fair ones."
</p>

<p>
"It dates as far back as the days of the first
Stuart, and men say, Walter, that its founder was
William de Napier, a stark warrior of King
Robert II.; but fair though the mansion, and
broad the lands around it, the greedy gleds of our
council-board will soon rend all piecemeal.  Soldiers,
blow your matches, and give all who attempt
to escape a prick of the hog's-bristle."
</p>

<p>
The musqueteers cautiously surrounded the
lofty edifice, resistance to the death being an
every-day occurrence&mdash;but the windows remained
dark, and the vast old manor-house exhibited no
sign of life, save where between the half-parted
shutters of a thickly-grated window a ray of flaky
light streamed into the obscurity without.  To this
opening the curious macer immediately applied
his legal eye, and cried in a loud whisper,
</p>

<p>
"Look ye here, Sirs, and behauld the godly
Maister Ichabod himsel' sitting in the cosiest
neuk o' the ingle between the auld lady and her
kinswoman.  Hech! a gallows'-looking buckie he
is as ever skirled a psalm in the muirlands, or
testified at the Bowfoot, wi' a St. Johnstoun cravat
round his whaislin craig."
</p>

<p>
"Silence!" said Fenton in an agitated voice, as,
clutching the haft of his poniard, he applied his
face to the barred window; "silence, wretch, or
I will trounce thee!" and the scowling macer could
perceive that his colour came and went, and that
his eye sparkled with vivacity as he took a rapid
survey of the apartment.  "Fool, fool!" he
muttered, as a cracked voice was heard singing
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "I like ane owle in desart am,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That nichtlie there doth moan;<br />
  I like unto ane sparrow am,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the house-top alone."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"The true sough o' the auld conventicle," said
the bluff old sergeant, merrily.  "Hark your
honours, the game's afoot."
</p>

<p>
According to the rank of the house and the
fashion of the present time, the room which
Fenton surveyed would be deemed small for a
principal or state apartment; but it was richly
decorated with a stuccoed ceiling, divided into
deep compartments, as the walls were by
wainscotting, but in the pannels of the latter were
numerous anomalous paintings of scenery,
scripture pieces, armorial bearings, and the quaint
devices of the Scoto-Italian school.  An old ebony
buffet laden with glittering crystal and shining
plate massively embossed.  The furniture was
ancient, richly carved, and dark with time; stark,
high-backed chairs with red leather cushions, and
tables supported by lions legs and wyverns heads.
The floor was richly carpeted around the arched
fire-place, where a bright fire of coals and
roots burned cheerily, while the grotesque iron
fire-dogs around which the fuel was piled, were
glowing almost red-hot, and the blue ware of
Delft that lined the recess, reflected the kindly
warmth on all sides.  The ponderous fire-irons
were chained to the stone jambs&mdash;a necessary
precaution in such an age; and on a stone shield
appeared the blazon of the Napiers: <i>argent</i>, a
saltire, engrailed, between four roses, <i>gules</i>, and an
eagle in full flight, with the lance and motto,
"<i>Aye ready</i>."  A tall portrait of Sir Archibald
Napier in the dark armour of Charles the First's
age, appeared above it.
</p>

<p>
A young lady sat near the fire-place, and on
her the attention of the handsome eavesdropper
became immediately rivetted.  Her face was of a
very delicate cast of beauty; her bright blue eyes
were expressive of the utmost vivacity, as her
short upper lip and dimpled chin were of
archness and wit.  The fairness, the purity of her
complexion was dazzling, and her glittering hair
of the brightest auburn, fell in massive locks on
her white neck and stiff collar of starched lace.
A string of Scottish pearls alone confined them,
and they rolled over her shoulders in soft
profusion, adding to the grace of her round and
beautiful figure, which the hideous length of her long
stomacher, and the volume of her ample skirt
could not destroy.  She was Lilian Napier.
</p>

<p>
Opposite sat her grand-aunt, Lady Grizel, a
tall, stately, and at first sight, grim old dame, as
stiff as a tremendous boddice, a skirt of the
heaviest brocade, the hauteur of the age, and an
inborn sense of much real and more imaginary
dignity, could make her.  Frizzled with the nicest
care, her lint-white locks were all drawn upwards,
thus adding to the dignity of her noble features,
though withered by care and blanched by time;
and the healthy bloom of the young girl near her
made the contrast between them greater: it was
the summer and the winter of life contrasted.  Lady
Grizel's forehead was high, her nose decidedly
aquiline, her eyes grey and keen, her brows a
perfect arch.  Though less in stature, and softer
in feature, her kinswoman strongly resembled her;
and though one was barely eighteen, and the other
bordering on eighty, their dresses were quite the
same; their gorgeously flowered brocades, their
vandyked cuffs, high collars, and red-heeled shoes,
were all similar.
</p>

<p>
As was natural in so young a man, Walter
Fenton remarked only the younger lady, whose
quick, small hands toyed with a flageolet, and a
few leaves of music, while her more industrious
grand-aunt was busily urging a handsome
spinning-wheel, the silver and ivory mountings of
which flashed in the light of the fire, as it sped
round and round.  Close at her feet lay an
aged staghound, that raised its head and erected
its bristles at times, as if aware that foes were
nigh.
</p>

<p>
There was such an air of happiness and domestic
comfort in that noble old chamber-of-dais, that
the young volunteer felt extremely loth to be one
of those who should disturb it; but fairly opposite
the glowing fire, in the most easy chair in the
room, (a great cushioned one, valanced round
with silken bobs,) sat he of whom they were in
search, and whom the macer had pronounced so
worthy of martyrdom.
</p>

<p>
He was a spare but athletic man, above the
middle height; his blue bonnet hung on a knob
of his chair, and his straight dark hair hung in
dishevelled masses around his lean, lank visage,
and sallow neck.  His face was gaunt, with red
and prominent cheek-bones; his eyes intensely
keen, penetrating, and generally unsettled in
expression.  He wore clerical bands falling over
that part of his heavily skirted and wide-cuffed
coat, where lapelles would have been had such
been the fashion of the day; his breeches and
spatterdashes were of rusty grey cloth; his large
eyes seemed fixed on vacancy, and his hands were
clasped on his left knee.  When he spoke his
whole face seemed to be convulsed by a spasm.
</p>

<p>
"Maiden," said he, reproachfully, "and ye
will not accompany me in the godly words of
Andro Hart's Scottish metre?"
</p>

<p>
"Think of the danger of being overheard,
Mr. Bummel," urged the young lady.  "I will sing
you my new song, the <i>Norlan' Harp</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Name it not, maiden, for thy profane songs
sound as abomination in my ears!"
</p>

<p>
Lilian Napier laughed merrily, and all her white
teeth glittered like pearls.
</p>

<p>
"Fair as thou art to look upon, maiden, and
innocent withal, the fear grieves me that ye are
one of the backsliders of this sinful generation.
Thy 'Norlan' Harp' quotha?  Know that there
is no harp save that of Zion, whilk is a lyre of
treble refined gold.  What saith the sacred writ,&mdash;'Is
any among ye afflicted, let him pray.  Is
any merrie, let him <i>sing psalmes</i>.'"
</p>

<p>
"I wot it would be but sad merriment,"
laughed the young lady.
</p>

<p>
"Peace, Lilian," said grand-aunt Grizel, while
the solemn divine fidgetted in his chair, and
hemmed gruffly, preparatory to returning to the
charge.
</p>

<p>
"Maiden, when thou hast perused my forthcoming
discourse, whilk is entitled, '<i>A Bombshell
aimed at the tail of the Great Beast</i>,' and
whilk, please God, shall be imprinted when I can
procure ink and irons from Holland (that happy
Elysium of the faithful), thou shalt there see in
words of fire the straight and narrow path,
contrasted with the broad but dangerous way that
leadeth to the sea of flame: and therein will I
shew thee, and all that are yet in darkness, that
the four animals in the Vision of Daniel
hieroglyphically represent four empires, Rome, Persia,
Grecia, and Babylonia, and that the man of sin,
the antichrist, and the scarlet harlot of Babylon&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
At that moment the stag-hound barked and
howled furiously, upon which the preacher's voice
died away in a quaver, and his upraised hand
sank powerless by his side.
</p>

<p>
"The dog howls eerily," said the old lady,
"Gude sain us! that foretells death&mdash;and far-seen
folk say that dumb brutes can see him enter the
house when a departure is about to happen."
</p>

<p>
"&mdash;And further," continued the preacher
incoherently, when his confusion had somewhat
subsided: "I will show thee that the blessing of
Heaven will descend upon the men of the Covenant&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yea," chimed in Lady Grizel, "and upon their
children&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Even unto the third and fourth generation."
</p>

<p>
"My honoured husband was as true a cavalier
as ever wore buff," said Lady Grizel, striking her
cane emphatically on the floor; "but some of my
dearest kinsmen have shed bluid for the other
side, and I can think kindly o' baith."
</p>

<p>
"But if the King," urged Lilian; "if the King
should permit&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Maiden!" cried Mr. Bummel, in a shrill and
stern voice; "mean ye the bloody and papistical
Duke James, who, contrary to religion and to law,
hath usurped the throne of this unhappy land&mdash;that
throne from which (as I show in my <i>Bombshell</i>)
justice hath debarred him&mdash;that throne from
the steps of which the blood of God's children,
the blessed sancts of our oppressed and martyred
Kirk, rolls down on every hand!  But the hour
cometh, Lilian, when it is written, that he shall
perish, and a new religious and political millenium
will dawn on these persecuted kingdoms.  On
one hand we have the power of the horned beast
that sitteth upon seven hills, and her best beloved
son James, with his thumbscrews, the iron boots
and gory maiden,&mdash;the savage Amorites of the
Highland hills&mdash;who go bare-legged to battle&mdash;yea,
maiden, naked as the heretical Adamites of
Bohemia&mdash;those birds of Belial, the soldiers of
Dunbarton&mdash;those kine of Bashan, the troopers
of Claverse, of Lag and Dalyel, the fierce
Muscovite cannibal&mdash;in England the <i>lambs</i> of Kirke,
and the gallows of the Butcher Jeffreys&mdash;a sea of
blood, of darkness, death, and horror!  But
lo! on the other hand, behold ye the dawn of a new
morn of peace, of love, and mercy; when the
exile shall be restored to his hearth, and the
doomed shall be snatched from the scaffold&mdash;for
he cometh, at whose approach the doors of a
thousand dungeons shall fly open, the torch of rapine
be extinguished, the sword of the persecutor
sheathed, and when the flowers shall bloom, and
the grass grow green on the lonely graves of our
ten thousand martyrs.  Yea&mdash;he, the Saviour&mdash;William
of Orange!"
</p>

<p>
The eyes of Ichabod Bummel filled with fire and
enthusiasm as he spoke; the crimson glowed in
his sallow cheek&mdash;the intonations of his voice
alternated between a whistle and a growl, and with
his hands clenched above his head, he concluded
this outburst, which gave great uneasiness and
even terror to the old lady, though Lilian smiled
with ill-concealed merriment.
</p>

<p>
"You have all heard this tirade of treason and
folly?" said Douglas to his soldiers.
</p>

<p>
"Hech me!" ejaculated the macer, drawing a
long breath; "it is enough to hang, draw, and
quarter a haill parochin, I think."
</p>

<p>
"The Dutch rebel!" exclaimed Douglas, whose
loyalty was fired.  "Soldiers! look well that none
escape by the windows; close up, my 'birds of
Belial;' and, harkee, Sergeant Wemyss, tirl at the
pin there."
</p>

<p>
The risp rung, and the door resounded beneath
the blows of the halberdier.  Lilian shrieked,
Lady Grizel grew pale, and all the blood left the
cheeks of the poor preacher, save the two scarlet
spots on his cheek-bones.
</p>

<p>
"Woe is me!" he shouted; "for, lo! the
Philistines are upon me!"
</p>

<p>
"The Guards of Pontius Pilate, he means,"
said the soldiers, as they gave a reckless laugh.
</p>

<p>
A shutter flew open, and the fair face of Lilian
Napier, with all her bright hair waving around it,
appeared for a moment gazing into the obscurity
without.
</p>

<p>
"Soldiers! soldiers!" she screamed, as the light
fell on corslets and accoutrements.  "O!  Aunt
Grizel, we are ruined, disgraced, and undone for
ever!"

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The entrance to the mansion was by the
narrow tower already described, and which
contained what is called in Scotland the Turnpike, a
spiral stair, turning sharply round on its axis.
The small doorway was heavily moulded, and
ornamented above by a mossy coat armorial, the
saltire and four roses.  The door was of massive
oak, covered with a profusion of iron studs, and
furnished with two eyelet holes, through which
visitors could be reconnoitred, or, if necessary,
favoured with a dose of musketry.
</p>

<p>
"What graceless runions are you, that knock
in this way, and sae near the deid hour of the
nicht, too?" asked the querulous voice of old
John Leekie, the gardener, while two rays of
streaming light through the eylets imparted to the
doorway the aspect of some gigantic visage, of
which the immense risp was the nose.
</p>

<p>
"Gae wa' in peace," added the venerable butler,
in a very blustering voice, "or bide to face
the waur!"
</p>

<p>
"Open, rascals!" cried the sergeant, "or we
will set the four corners of the house on fire."
</p>

<p>
"Doubtless, my bauld buckie," chuckled the
old serving-man; "but the wa's are thick, and
the winnocks weel grated, and we gaed a stronger
band o' the English Puritans their kail through
the reek in the year saxteen-hunderd-and-fifty."  The
over-night potations of the aged vassals had
endued them with a courage unusual at that time,
when a whole village trembled at the sight of a
soldier.
</p>

<p>
"Wha are ye, sirs!" queried the butler, Mr. Drouthy;
"wha are ye?"
</p>

<p>
"Those who are empowered to storm the house
if its barriers are not opened forthwith!" replied
the sonorous voice of Douglas; "so, up! varlets! and
be doing, for the soldiers of the King cannot
bide your time."
</p>

<p>
The only reply to this was a smothered exclamation
of fear from various female voices within,
and the clank of one or two additional heavy
bolts being shot into their places; and then
succeeded the clatter of various slippers and
high-heeled shoes, as the household retreated up the
steep turnpike in great dismay.
</p>

<p>
"Now, ye dyvour loons!" cried the old butler,
from a shot-hole, "we'll gie ye a taste o' the
Cromwell days, if ye dinna mak' toom the barbican in
five minutes.  Lads," he continued, as if speaking
to men behind, although, save the old and equally
intoxicated gardener, the whole household were
women; "lads, tak' the plugs frae the loop-holes.
John Leekie, burn a light in the north turret,
and in a crack we'll hae our chields frae the
grange wi' pitchfork, pike, and caliver.  Awa' to
the vaults and bartizan&mdash;blaw your coals, and fire
cannily when I tout my old hunting horn."
</p>

<p>
These orders caused a muttering among the
soldiers, who were quite unprepared to find the
house garrisoned and ready for resistance.  An
additional puffing of gun-matches ensued, and all
eyes were bent to the turrets and those parts
which were battlemented; but no man appeared
therein or thereon, and the thundering was
renewed at the door with great energy.  Suddenly
the bolts were withdrawn, the door revolved
slowly on its hinges, and the musqueteers who
were about to rush in, hung back with mingled
indecision and respect.
</p>

<p>
In the doorway stood Lady Grizel Napier,
leaning on her long walking-cane; her dark-grey
eyes lit up with indignation, and her forehead,
though marked by the furrows of eighty years,
still expressive of dignity and determination;
nearly six feet in height, erect and stately as lace
and brocade could make her, she was the belle
ideal of an old Scottish matron.  She wore on the
summit of her frizzled hair a little coif of
widow-hood, which she had never laid aside since her
husband was slain at Inverkeithing; and the
circumstance of his having died by a Puritan's hand
alone made her somewhat cold in the cause of
the Covenant.  Her retinue of female servitors
crowded fearfully behind her, and by her side
appeared the silver-haired butler, armed with a
huge partisan, while a battered morion covered
his head, as it often had done in many a tough
day's work; and behind him staggered the old
gardener, armed with a watering-pan, and a steel
cap with the peak behind.
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen," said the old lady, in a tone of
great asperity, while striking her long cane thrice
on the doorstep, and all her frills seemed to ruffle
with indignation like the feathers of a swan;
"Gentlemen, what want ye at this untimeous
hour?  Know ye not that this is a house whilk
we are entitled by Crown charter to fortify and
defend, as well against domestic enemies as
foreign! and methinks it is a daring act, and a
graceless to boot, to march with cocked matches,
and bodin in array of war on the bounds of a
lone auld woman like me.  By my faith, in the
days of my honoured Sir Archibald, ye had gone
off our barony faster than ye came, king's soldiers
though ye be."
</p>

<p>
"Excuse us, madam," replied Douglas, lowering
his rapier, and bowing with a peculiar grace which
then was only to be acquired by service in
France: "we have a warrant from the Lords of
his Majesty's Privy Council, to arrest the persons
of a certain Captain Napier, of a Scots Dutch
regiment, and the Reverend Mr. Ichabod Bummel,
who are accused of being treasonable emissaries
of the States-General&mdash;intercommuned traitors,
and now concealed in your mansion.  Your
Ladyship must be aware that implicit obedience
is the soldier's first duty: surrender unto us these
guilty men, otherwise your house must be ransacked
by my soldiers,&mdash;a severe humiliation,
which I would willingly spare the baronial
mansion of a dame of honour, more especially when I
remember the rank and loyal service of her
husband."
</p>

<p>
"Gude keep us, Laird of Finland," replied the
old lady, trembling violently and leaning on her
cane.  "O what dool is this that hath come upon
us at last?  My dream&mdash;my dream&mdash;it forewarned
me of this: as the rhyme saith&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "A Friday nicht's grue<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Saturday tauld,<br />
  Is sure to come true,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be it never sae auld."<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"On my honour&mdash;nae such persons&mdash;I protest to
you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Enough, Lady Grizel," replied Douglas, with
a little hauteur; "positively we must spare you
the trouble, if not the shame, of making those
unavailing but humiliating assertions, which the
laws of humanity and hospitality require.  The
sooner this affair is over the better&mdash;we crave
your pardon, madam, but the king's service is
paramount.  Serjeant Wemyss, guard the door&mdash;follow
me, Walter&mdash;forward, soldiers, and I will
unearth this clerical fox!"
</p>

<p>
Rushing past Lady Grizel, while the startled
household fled before them, the musqueteers
pressed forward into the chamber-of-dais; but
the Reverend Mr. Bummel had vanished, and no
trace remained of him, save his ample blue bonnet,
with its red cherry or tuft, and Walter Fenton
was certainly not the last to perceive that the
young lady had disappeared also.
</p>

<p>
"Search the whole house, from roof-tree to
foundations," exclaimed Douglas; "cut down all
who make the least resistance; but on your lives
beware of plunder or destruction&mdash;away!"
</p>

<p>
A violent and unscrupulous search was made
forthwith; every curtain, every bed and pannel
were pierced by swords and daggers; every press,
bunker, and girnel&mdash;the turrets and all the
innumerable nooks and corners of the old house were
searched.  Every lockfast place was blown open
by musket-balls, and thirty stentorian voices
summoned the miserable preacher "to come
forth;" but he was nowhere to be found.  Pale
and trembling between terror and indignation,
propped on her long cane, the old lady stood
under her baronial canopy on the dais of the
dining-hall, listening to the uproar that rang
through all the stone-vaults, wainscotted chambers,
and long corridors of her mansion, and regarding
Richard Douglas and his friend the young volunteer,
with glances of pride and hostility.
</p>

<p>
Walter Fenton coloured deeply, and appeared
both agitated and confused; but Douglas coolly
and collectedly leaned against the buffet, toying
with the knot of his rapier, and drinking a cup
of wine to Lady Bruntisfield's health, helping
himself from the buffet uninvited.
</p>

<p>
"Lady Grizel," said he, "by surrendering up
these foolish and guilty men, whom, contrary to
law, you have harboured and resetted within your
barony, you may considerably avert the wrath of
the already incensed Council."
</p>

<p>
"Never, Sir! never will I be guilty of such a
breach of hospitality and honour.  Bethink ye,
Sirs, the Captain Napier is my sister's son, and
it would ill become a Scottish dame to prove false
to her ain blude.  The minister, though but a
gomeral body, is his friend&mdash;one of those whom
the people deem exiled and persecuted for Christ's
sake&mdash;ye may hew me to pieces with your partisans,
but never would I yield a fugitive to the
tortures and executioners of that bluidy and
infamous Council."  And to give additional force
to her words, Lady Grizel as usual struck the
floor thrice with her cane.
</p>

<p>
"Lady Bruntisfield," said Walter Fenton,
gently, "beware lest our soldiers, or that dog the
macer overhear you."
</p>

<p>
"Glorious canary this!" muttered the Lieutenant,
apostrophizing the silver mug&mdash;"hum&mdash;I
believe your ladyship is a Presbyterian."
</p>

<p>
"Though unused to be catechised by soldiers,"
replied the dame, drawing herself up with great
dignity, "I acknowledge what all my neighbours
know.  I am Presbyterian, thank God, and so are
all my household, who never miss a sabbath at
kirk or meeting; and our minister is one, who
having complied with the government regulations,
hath an indulgence to preach."
</p>

<p>
"This applies not to the spy of that rogue
William of Orange&mdash;this pious Ichabod, whom
we must hale forth by the lugs at every risk."
</p>

<p>
"Never before was I suspected of disloyalty
to the Scottish Crown," said Lady Grizel, sobbing,
"and now in my auld and donnart days, with ane
foot in the grave, it's hard to thole, Sirs&mdash;it's hard to
thole.  How often hae these hands, wrinkled now,
and withered though they be, laced steel cap, greave
and corslet, on my buirdly husband and his three
fair sons.  Ehwhow, Sirs! how often hae my very
heart pulses died away with the clang o' their
horses' hoofs in yonder avenue.  Ane fell at
Dumbar&mdash;another in his stirrups at the sack of
Dundee, and my fair-haired Archy, my youngest
and my best beloved, the apple o' my e'e, was
shot deid by the side of his dying father, on the
field of Inverkeithing.  Save my sister's
grandchild, all I loved have gone before me to
God&mdash;but though my heart be seared, and my bower
desolate, O Laird of Finland, this disgrace is
harder to thole than a' I hae tholed in my time."
</p>

<p>
Touched with her sorrow, Walter Fenton and
Finland approached her; but ere they could
speak, a dismal voice, that seemed to ascend from
the profundity of some vast tun, was heard to
sing, "I like an owle in desert am," &amp;c., and the
verse was scarcely concluded when the officer burst
into a violent fit of laughter.
</p>

<p>
"O, ye fule man!" exclaimed the old lady,
shaking her cane wrathfully: "ye have ruined
yoursel' and the House of Bruntisfield too!"
</p>

<p>
"Where the devil is he?" said Douglas.  "Ah,
there must be some pannel here," he added,
knocking on the wainscot with the pommel of his
sword.
</p>

<p>
"He is not very far off, your honour," said the
macer approaching, pushing his bonnet on one
side, and scratching his head with an air of vulgar
drollery and perplexity.  "I'll wager ye a score
o' broad pieces, Finland, that I howk out the tod
in a moment."
</p>

<p>
"Then do so," said Douglas, haughtily, "but
first, you irreverend knave, doff your bonnet in
the Lady Bruntisfield's presence."
</p>

<p>
"There is something queer about this braw
Flanders wag-at-the-wa'," said the macer,
approaching a clock, the case of which formed part
of the wainscotting.  It was violently shaken, and
emitted a hollow groan.  The macer opened the
narrow pannel, and revealed the poor preacher
coiled up within, in great spiritual and bodily
tribulation, and half stifled by want of air.  His
face was almost black, his eyes bloodshot, and his
features sharpened by an expression of delirious
terror bordering on the ludicrous.
</p>

<p>
"Dolt and fool!" exclaimed Walter, "what
fiend tempted ye to rant thus within earshot of
us?"
</p>

<p>
"Gadso, I think the varlet's mad," said Douglas,
laughing.  "Dost think we will eat thee,
fellow?"
</p>

<p>
"Mad!&mdash;I hope so, for the sake of this noble
lady."
</p>

<p>
"And the marrow in his bones, Fenton."
</p>

<p>
"Come awa, my man," said the macer, making
him a mock bow; "use your shanks while the
ungodly Philistines will let you.  Ye'll no walk
just sae weel after you have tried on the braw
buits my Lord Chancellor keeps for such pious
gentlemen as you."
</p>

<p>
"From these sons of blood and Belial, good
Lord deliver me!" ejaculated the poor man, turning
up his hollow eyes, as he was dragged forth;
"ye devouring wolves, I demand your warrant
for what ye do?"
</p>

<p>
"Macer&mdash;your warrant?" said Douglas.
</p>

<p>
Unfolding the slip of paper, the worthy
official now reverentially took off his bonnet, and
in a sing-song voice drawled forth&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I, Michael Maclutchy, macer to the Privy
Council of Scotland, by virtue <i>of</i>, and conform
<i>to</i>, the principal letters raised at ye instance
of Maister Roderick Mackenzie, Advocat-Depute
to Sir David Dalrymple, His Majesty's Advocat,
summon, warn, and charge <i>you</i>, the said Reverend
Mr. Hugh&mdash;otherwise Ichabod Bummel&mdash;is that
richt, friend?"
</p>

<p>
"Yea&mdash;I was so named by my parents Hugh, a
heathenish name, whilk in a better hour I changit
to Ichabod, signifying in the Hebrew
tongue&mdash;'where is glory?'"
</p>

<p>
"Weel&mdash;weel, mind na the Hebrew&mdash;charge
you to surrender peaceably&mdash;and sae forth; it's a'
there in black and white: subscribitur <i>Perth</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Fie upon ye!" exclaimed Ichabod, "ye abjurers
of the Lord, and persecutors of his covenanted
kirk."
</p>

<p>
"Away with him!" said Fenton to the soldiers.
</p>

<p>
"Truly ye are properly clad in scarlet, for it is
the garb&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Silence, Sir; you make bad worse."
</p>

<p>
"Of your Babylonian mother."
</p>

<p>
"Peace!" cried Douglas.
</p>

<p>
"I liken ye even unto broken reeds&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"On with the gyves, and away wi' him!"
said the serjeant, and the poor crack-brained
enthusiast was unceremoniously handcuffed and
dragged away, pouring a torrent of hard scriptural
epithets and invectives on his captors, and
chanting suitable verses from Andro Hart's book
of the <i>Psalmes</i>.
</p>

<p>
Lady Bruntisfield started as he was taken away,
and was about to bestow on him some address
of comfort and farewell; but the young volunteer
interposed, saying with great gentleness,
</p>

<p>
"Pardon me, Lady Grizel&mdash;by addressing him
you will only compromise your own safety and
honour.  O madam, I deeply regret your involvement
in this matter!  The Privy Council is not
to be trifled with."
</p>

<p>
"Madam," observed Douglas, "I believe I
have the honour of being not unknown to you?"
</p>

<p>
"You are the young Laird of Finland, who
wounded my nephew Quentin&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"In a duel in Flanders&mdash;O yes&mdash;ha! ha! we
quarrelled about little Babette of the Hans-in-Kelder,
or some folly of that kind.  I acquaint
you, madam, with regret, that in consequence of
this trumpeter of rebellion being found resetted
here&mdash;your whole family&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Alake, Laird, I have only my little grand-niece."
</p>

<p>
"Your whole household must be considered
prisoners until the pleasure of the Council is
known.  In the interim," he added in a low voice,
"I hope your kinsman will escape; though he has
been no friend of mine since that time we fought
with sword and dagger on the ramparts of Tournay,
I would wish him another fate than a felon's,
for a braver fellow never marched under baton.
Meanwhile, Lady Bruntisfield, I am your
servant&mdash;adieu;" and bowing until his plume touched
the floor, he withdrew.
</p>

<p>
Leaving his veteran serjeant, and Walter the
volunteer, with twenty men to keep ward, he
returned to the city with his prisoner, who was
immediately consigned to the Iron Room of the
Tolbooth.
</p>

<p>
For a few minutes after his departure Lady
Grizel seemed quite stunned by the dilemma in
which she so suddenly found herself.  She had
now been joined by Lilian, who hung upon her
shoulder weeping; for the Privy Council of
Scotland was a court of religious and political
inquisition, whose name and satellites bore terror
throughout the land.
</p>

<p>
Sergeant Wemyss posted seven of his musketeers
within the barbican, with orders "to keep
all in who were within, and all out who were so;"
after which he withdrew with the remainder to
the spacious and vaulted kitchen, where, as
occupying free quarters, they made themselves quite at
home, and crowded round the great wood-fire that
was roaring in the vast archway which spanned
one side of the apartment, joked and toyed with
the half-pleased and half-frightened maids, and
compelled the indignant housekeeper (who, with
Lady Grizel's cast coifs and fardingales assumed
many of her airs) to provide them with a substantial
supper, the least items of which were a huge
side of beef, a string of good fat capons, and an
unmeasured quantity of ale and usquebaugh for
the soldiers; while his honour the halberdier
insisted on wine dashed with brandy, swearing
"by the devil's horns," and other cavalier oaths,
"he would drink nothing but the best Rhenish."  There
was an immense consumption of viands,
and as the revellers became merrier, they made
the whole house ring to their famous camp-song,
</p>

<p class="t3">
  "Dunbarton's drums beat bonnie, O,"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
to the great envy of those luckless wights in the
barbican, who heard only the bleak March wind
sighing among the leafless woods, and witnessed
through the windows all this hilarity and good
cheer from which they were for a time debarred.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Drouthy the butler, and other old servitors,
who had seen something of free quarters under
the Duke of Hamilton in England, entered heartily
into the spirit of entertaining their noisy visitors,
to whom they detailed the fields of Inverkeithing,
Dunbar, and Kerbeister, with great vociferation,
and ever and anon voted the Reverend Mr. Bummel
a most unqualified bore, and declared that
"the house of Bruntisfield was weel rid of his
grunting and skirling about owls and sparrows in
the desert."

<h3>
CHAPTER IV.
<br /><br />
A PAIR OF BLUE EYES.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Thou tortur'st me.  I hate all obligations<br />
  Which I can ne'er return&mdash;and who art thou,<br />
  That I should stoop to take them from your hand?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FATAL CURIOSITY.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The post of honour&mdash;that in the hall or lobby
immediately outside the room occupied by the
ladies&mdash;had been appropriated by the serjeant to
Walter Fenton.
</p>

<p>
The young man placed his pike across the door
of the chamber of dais (as the dining-hall was
named in those Scottish houses, which, though to
all intents baronial, were not castles) and then
paced slowly to and fro.
</p>

<p>
A lamp, the chain of which was suspended from
the mouth of a grotesque face carved on the wall,
lighted the lobby or ambulatory, and dimly its
flickering rays were reflected by a rusty trophy of
ancient weapons opposite.  An old head-piece
and chain-jacket formed the centre, while
crossbows, matchlocks, partisans, and two-handed
swords, radiated round them.  A deer's skull and
antlers, riding gambadoes, heavy whips and spurs,
a row of old knobby chairs, and a clumsy oaken
clock, which (like many persons in the world)
had two faces, one looking to the lobby, the other
to the dining-hall, ticked sullenly in a corner, and
made up the furniture of the place.
</p>

<p>
Save the monotonous vibrations of the clock,
and an occasional murmur of voices from the
chamber of dais, no other sound disturbed the
solitary watch of Fenton, unless when a distant
shout of hilarity burst from the vaulted kitchen,
and reverberated through the winding staircases
and stone corridors of the ancient mansion.
</p>

<p>
Absorbed in meditation, the young man walked
slowly to and fro, turning with something of
military briskness at each end of the half-darkened
passage, by the indifferent light of which we must
present a view of him to the reader.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "A young man, gentle-voiced and gentle-eyed,<br />
  Who looked and spake like one the world had frowned on."<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
He seemed to be about twenty years of age; of a
rather tall and very handsome figure, which his
scarlet sleeves, and corslet tapering to the waist,
and tightly compressed by a broad buff belt
sustaining a plainly-mounted sword and dagger,
tended greatly to improve.  The cheek-plates of
his burgonet, or steel cap, were unclasped, and
his dark-brown hair rolled over his polished gorget
in the profuse fashion of the time; his pale
forehead was thoughtful and intellectual in expression;
but the gilt peak of his cap partly concealed it,
and cast a shadow over a very prepossessing face
of a dark complexion, and somewhat melancholy
contour.  His dark eye had a soft and pleasing
expression, though at times it loured and overcast.
The curve of his lips, though gentle, and haughty,
and scornful, by turns, was ever indicative of
firmness and decision.  They were red and full as
those of a girl; but short black mustaches, pointed
smartly upward, imparted a military aspect to a
face such as few could contemplate without
interest&mdash;especially women.  With the manner of
one who has early learned to think, and hold
communion with himself, his eye sparkled and his
cheek flushed as certain ideas occurred to him:
anon his animation died away, he sighed deeply,
and thus immersed in his own thoughts, continued
to pace to and fro, until at the half-opened
door of the chamber of dais there appeared the
fair face of Lilian Napier&mdash;a face so regular in its
contour of eyebrow, lip, and nostril, that the
brightness of her blue eyes, and the waving of her
auburn ringlets, together with a decided piquancy
of expression, alone prevented it from being
insipid.  She was looking cautiously out.
</p>

<p>
On recognizing her, Fenton bowed, and the
girl blushed deeply, as she said hurriedly, and in
a low voice,
</p>

<p>
"O joy!  Walter Fenton, is it indeed you? how
fortunate! but oh, what a night this has been for
us all!"
</p>

<p>
"Mistress Lilian," said he (the prefix Miss as
a title of honour did not become common until
the beginning of the next century) "need I say
that it has been a night of sorrow and mortification
to me?  Yet, God wot, what could I do but obey
the orders of my superiors?"
</p>

<p>
"Hush!" she whispered; for at that moment
Lady Bruntisfield came forth, pale and agitated,
with eyes red from recent weeping.
</p>

<p>
Tall in form and majestic in bearing, Lady
Grizel Napier, as I have said before, was one of
those stately matrons who appear to have departed
with their hoops and fardingales.  In youth, her
face had possessed more than ordinary beauty,
and now, in extreme old age, it still retained its
feminine softness and pleasing expression.
Undecided in politics, she was intensely loyal to
James; while condemning his government, she
railed at the non-conformists and reprobated the
severities of the council in the same breath.  Like
every dame of the olden time, she was a matchless
mediciner, and maker of preserves, conserves,
physics, and cordials, and, did a vassal's finger but
ache, Lady Grizel was consulted forthwith.  Like
every woman of her time, she was intensely
superstitious: she shook her purse when the pale
crescent of the new moon rose above the Corstorphine
woods; if the salt-foot was overturned, she
remembered Judas, trembled, and threw a pinch
over her left shoulder; she saw coffins in the fire,
letters in the candles, and quaked at deidspales
when they guttered in the wind.  She listened in
fear to the chakymill, or death-watch, which often
ticked obstinately for a whole night in the massive
posts of her canopied bed.  Witches, of course,
were a constant source of hatred and annoyance,
and, notwithstanding her great faith in the Holy
Kirk (and a little in Peden's Prophecies), she had
such a wholesome dread of the Prince of darkness,
that, according to the ancient usage, a piece of
her lands adjoining the Harestane was dedicated
to him, under the dubious name of <i>the gudeman's
croft</i>, and, in defiance of all the acts against this
old superstition (which still exists in remote parts
of Scotland), it was allowed to remain a weedy
waste, unsown and unemployed.  With all this,
her manners were high-bred and courtly; her
information extensive; and there was in her air
a certain indescribable loftiness, which then
consciousness of noble birth and long descent inspired,
and which failed not to enforce due respect from
equals and inferiors.
</p>

<p>
On her approach, Walter Fenton bowed with
an air in which politeness and commiseration were
gracefully blended.  Her bright-haired kinswoman
leant upon her arm, and from time to time stole
furtive and timid glances at the volunteer beneath
her long eyelashes.
</p>

<p>
"Young man," said Lady Bruntisfield, "for a
soldier, you seem good and gentle.  Have you a
mother" (her voice faltered) "who is dear to
you&mdash;a sister whom you love?"
</p>

<p>
"Nor mother, nor sister, nor kindred have I,
madam.  Alas!  Lady Grizel, I am alone in the
world: the first, and perhaps it may be the last,
of my race," he added bitterly.  "But what would
your ladyship with Walter Fenton?"
</p>

<p>
"Ha! are you one of the Fentons of that Ilk?"
</p>

<p>
"Nay, lady, I am only Walter Fenton of the
Scottish Musqueteers, and nothing more: but in
what can I serve you?"
</p>

<p>
"How shall I speak it?&mdash;That you will sleep
on your post, and permit this poor child&mdash;dost
comprehend me?&mdash;oh!  I will nobly reward you;
and the deed will be registered elsewhere."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no!&mdash;no! beg no such boon for me,"
said the blushing and trembling girl; while the
brow of the young man became clouded.
</p>

<p>
"You would counsel me to my ruin, Lady
Bruntisfield: is it generous, is it noble, when I am
but a poor soldier?  Seek not to corrupt me by
gold," he said hurriedly, on the old lady drawing
a purse from her girdle; "for all I possess is my
honour, the poor man's best inheritance.  And
yet, for the sake of Lilian Napier, I would dare
much."
</p>

<p>
The deep blush which suffused the soft cheek
and white brow of Lilian as the pikeman spoke,
was not unobserved by the elder lady; and she
said, with undisguised hauteur,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"How is this, sir sentinel?&mdash;ye know my kinswoman,
and by that glance it would seem that ye
have met before.  Lilian, do thou speak."
</p>

<p>
Lilian trembled, but was silent and confused.
</p>

<p>
"I have often had the honour of seeing Mistress
Lilian at my Lord Dunbarton's," said the young
man, hastening to her relief.
</p>

<p>
"How! are you little Fenton?"
</p>

<p>
"The Countess's page, madam."
</p>

<p>
"By my father's bones!" said Lady Grizel,
striking the floor angrily with her cane; "I little
thought a time would come when I would sue a
boon in vain, either from a lord's loon or a lady's
foot-page!"
</p>

<p>
These words seemed to sting the young soldier
deeply; fire sparkled in his eyes.  But tears
suffused those of Lilian.
</p>

<p>
"Madam," said he firmly, "I am the first
private gentleman of Dunbarton's Foot, and am
so unused to such hauteur, that had the best man
in broad Scotland uttered words like these, my
sword had assuredly taken the measure of his
body."
</p>

<p>
"I admire your spirit, sir," said Lady Grizel
gently; "but it might be shewn in a more honourable
cause than the persecution of helpless women-folk."
</p>

<p>
"Lady Grizel, a soldier from my childhood, I
have been inured to hardship and trained to face
every danger.  My conscience is my own; my
soul belongs to God: and my sword to the King
and Parliament of Scotland, whose orders I must
obey."
</p>

<p>
"Then, gentle sir, be generous as your bearing
is noble, and, in the name of God, permit my little
kinswoman to escape.  Alas! you know well
what is in store for us, if we are dragged before
that odious Privy Council&mdash;fine, imprisonment,
torture&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Or banishment to Virginia," said Lilian,
bursting into tears.
</p>

<p>
"God wot I pity you, Lady Bruntisfield, and
would lay down my life to serve you.  Retire&mdash;I
will keep my post; your chamber has windows by
which&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Alas! they are grated, and there are sentinels
without."
</p>

<p>
Fenton stamped his foot impatiently.
</p>

<p>
"Birds' eggs aye bring ill luck; and oh! Lilian,
ye thoughtless bairn, when ye strung up the pyets
yesternight, I forewarned ye that something would
happen.  The thumbscrews and extortions of the
Council, yea, and banishment even in my auld
age, I might bear, though the thocht of being laid
far frae the graves of my ain kindred is hard to
thole; but thee, my dear doo, Lilian&mdash;it is for thee
my heart bleeds."
</p>

<p>
"Oh! madam, they cannot be such villains as
to harm her&mdash;so young&mdash;so fair."
</p>

<p>
"You know not what I mean," replied Lady
Grizel, pressing her hands upon her breast, and
speaking in an incoherent and bitter manner.
"Lord Clermistonlee rules at the Council-board,
and he hath seen Lilian.  Wretch&mdash;wretch, too
well do I know 'tis for worse than the
thumb-screws he would reserve her!"
</p>

<p>
She paused; and Fenton starting, said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Oh, whence were all my unreasonable scruples?
Finland by his hints warned me of Clermistonlee,
that roué and ruffian, whose name brings scandal
on our peerage."
</p>

<p>
"Then let my dear aunt Grizel escape to some
place of concealment, and, good Mr. Fenton, you
shall have my prayers and gratitude for life."
</p>

<p>
It was the young girl who spoke; her accents
were low and imploring; and her whole appearance
was very fascinating, for her timidity and
mortification added the utmost expression to her
blue eyes, while her lips, half parted, shewed the
whiteness of her teeth, and lent a sweetness and
simplicity to her face.  The tenor of her address
made the heart of Walter flutter, for love was fast
subduing his scrupulous sense of duty.
</p>

<p>
"Artless Lilian," said he with a faint smile,
"Lord Clermistonlee aims neither at Lady Grizel's
liberty or life.  He is a villain of the deepest dye;
and you have many things to fear.  It ill beseems
a lady of birth to sue a boon from a poor sworder
such as I.  Leave me to my fate, and the fury of
the Council.  I am, I hope, a gentleman, though
an unfortunate one, and reduced to the necessity
of trailing a pike under the noble Earl of
Dunbarton; but in spirit I can be generous as a king,
though my whole inheritance is to follow the
drum."
</p>

<p>
"I offered you money&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Lady Grizel," said Fenton, colouring again,
"I hope that the poorest musqueteer who follows
the banner of Dunbarton would have rejected it
with scorn.  Though soldiers, we are not like
those rapacious wolves the troopers of Lag, of
Dalzel, or Kirke the Englishman.  By my faith,
madam, for six shillings Scots per day I have often
perilled life and limb in a worse cause than yours;
and why should I scruple now?  Escape while
there is yet time.  Lady Grizel, permit me to
lead you forth."
</p>

<p>
And, drawing off his leather glove, he offered
his hand to the old dame, who, struck by the
gallantry of his manner, said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"You have quite the air of a cavalier, such as I
mind o' in my young days, when the first Charles
was crowned in Holyrood."
</p>

<p>
"I pretend not to be a cavalier," said Walter,
with a sad smile: "the camp is the school of
gallantry."
</p>

<p>
"Fear for my Lilian makes me miserably selfish.
I would rather die, good youth, than that a hair of
your head should be injured; but that this delicate
bairn should be dragged before that fierce Council,
like some rude cottar's wife&mdash;'tis enough to make
the dead bones in the West-kirk aisle to clatter
in their coffins!  Ere we go, say what will be
your inevitable punishment for this dereliction of
duty?"
</p>

<p>
"A few days' close ward in the Abbey-guard,
with pease bannocks and sour beer to regale on,
and mounting guard at the Palace porch in back-breast
and headpieces, partisan, sword and dagger;
in full marching harness, for four-and-twenty
consecutive hours&mdash;that is all, madam," said he
gaily; though the inward forebodings of his heart
and his sad experience told him otherwise.  "In
serving <i>you</i>, fair Lilian," he added gently, and
half attempting, but not daring to touch her hand,
"I shall be more than a thousand times recompensed
for any penance I may perform.  Believe
me, it will weigh as a featherweight against what
the Council may inflict on Lady Bruntisfield.
Now, then, away in God's name!  Ye will surely
find a secure shelter somewhere among your
numerous friends and tenantry; but seek not the
city, for Dunbraiken's guards are on the alert at
every gate; and, above all, oh! beware of&mdash;of
Lord Clermistonlee, who (if Finland suspects truly)
has a deep project to accomplish."
</p>

<p>
"Heaven bless thee, good young man!" faltered
the venerable Lady Grizel, laying her small but
wrinkled hands upon his shoulders, and gazing on
him with eyes that beamed with heartfelt
gratitude.  "Alack! alack! my mind gangs back to
the time when three hearts as brave and as gentle
as yours, grew up from heartsome youth to stately
manhood under this auld roof-tree; but, oh,
waly! waly! the cauld blast o' war laid my three fair
flowers in the dust."
</p>

<p>
A noise in the kitchen, and the loud voice of the
halberdier calling fresh sentinels, now caused them
to hurry away.  To conceal about their persons
such jewels and money as they could collect from
the cabinets in the chamber of dais, to muffle up
in their hoods and mantles, to give one glance of
adieu to the portrait of the dark cavalier above
the fire-place, and another of gratitude to Walter
Fenton, were all the work of a minute,&mdash;and they
were led forth to the avenue.  Grey morning was
breaking in the east, and the black ridge of Arthur's
Seat stood in strong relief against the brightening
sky; the wind had died away, and the waning moon
shone cold and dim in the west, while, far to the
northward, the dark opaque clouds were piled in
shadowy masses above the bold and striking outline
of the capital.  There the great spire of the
Gothic cathedral, the ramparts of its rockbuilt
fortress, the crenelated towers of the Flodden-wall,
and the streets within "piled deep and massy,
close and high," were all glimmering in the first
pale rays of the dawn, though the valleys below,
and the woods around, were still sunk in the gloom
and obscurity of night.  A sentinel challenged
from the dark shadow of the barbican wall, and
his voice made the fugitives tremble with fear.
</p>

<p>
"Dunbarton," answered Walter, and on
receiving the password, the soldier stept back.
"And now, ladies, whence go ye?"
</p>

<p>
"As God shall direct&mdash;to some of our faithful
tenant bodies, for safety and concealment,"
sobbed Lady Bruntisfield.
</p>

<p>
"Poor Mr. Fenton!" murmured Lilian; "I
tremble more for you than for ourselves."
</p>

<p>
"A long farewell to our gude auld barony of
Bruntisfield and the Wrytes&mdash;to main and holm,
and wood and water," said Lady Grizel, mournfully;
"we stand under the shadow of its green
sauchs and oak woods for the last time.  Once
before I fled frae them, but that was in the year
fifty, when our natural enemies, the English, won
that doolfu' day at Dunbar, and again our hail
plenishing will be ruined and harried, as in the
days o' the ruffianly and ungracious Puritans."
</p>

<p>
"Not by us, Lady Bruntisfield," replied the
young man, slightly piqued; "we are the soldiers
of the gallant Dunbarton, the old Royals of
Turenne, les Gardes Ecossais of a thousand
battles and a thousand glorious memories, and your
mansion will be sacred as if in the hands of so
many apostles.  Farewell, and God speed ye!
Would that I could accompany your desolate
steps to some place of safety! but that would
discover all."  They parted.
</p>

<p>
"I have done," muttered Walter, striking his
breast; "and from this hour I am a lost man!"
</p>

<p>
Hastily returning, he resumed his post, with his
heart beating high with the conflicting emotions of
pleasure and apprehension.  Youth and beauty in
suffering, danger, or humiliation, form naturally
an object of interest and compassion; but Walter,
though pleased by the conviction that he had
done a good action, and one so fully involving the
gratitude of Lilian Napier and her haughty relative,
felt a dread of what was to ensue, weighing
heavily on his mind; for the Scottish privy
council was then composed of men with whom
the proudest noble dared not to trifle, and before
whom the pride and power of the great Argyle,
lord of a vast territory, and chief of the most
powerful of the western clans, bent like a reed
beneath the storm.  Poor Walter reflected, that
he was but a friendless and nameless volunteer,
and too well he knew that the council would not
be cheated of their prey without a terrible
vengeance.
</p>

<p>
Scarcely had he resumed his post in the
corridor, when the serjeant, whose brown visage was
flushed with carousing, and whose corslet braces
were unclasped to give space for the quantity of
viands he had imbibed, reeled up with a relief of
sentinels, all more or less in the same condition.
</p>

<p>
"All right, an't please you, Master Walter.  I
warrant you will be tired of this post of honour,
and longing for a leg of a devilled capon, and a
horn of the old butler's Rhenish."
</p>

<p>
"I thought you had forgotten me, Wemyss.
You will have a care, sir," said Walter, addressing
the soldier who relieved him, with a glance that
was not to be misunderstood, "that you do not
disturb the ladies by entering the chamber of
dais; dost hear me, thou pumpkin-head?"
</p>

<p>
"Rot me, Master Fenton, I have clanked my
bandoleers before the tent of Monsieur of France,
and I need nae be learned now, how to keep guard
on king or knave, baron or boor.  Dost think
that I, who am the son of an auld vassal of her
ladyship's, would dragoon her out of marching
money?"
</p>

<p>
"'Tis well," replied the pikeman, briefly, as he
retired, not to the kitchen, but to a solitary
apartment prepared for him by the orders of his old
patron, the halberdier.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V.
<br /><br />
A PAIR OF RAPIERS.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  If thou sleep alone in Urrard,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perchance in midnight gloom,<br />
  Thoul't hear behind the wainscot<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of that old and darken'd room<br />
  A fleshless hand that knocketh&mdash;&mdash;"<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HIGHLAND MINSTRELSY.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In a dark old wainscotted apartment, in the
small arched chimney of which a coal fire was
glowing cheerily, supper and wine were sullenly
laid for Walter by a sleepy and half-frightened
servant; but the first remained untouched and
the last untasted, at least for a time.  Removing
his burgonet and gloves, he sat with his elbow on
the table and his forehead on his hand, with his
fingers writhed among his thick dark locks.  He
was again sunk in one of his gloomy reveries; but
at times a smile of pleasure and animation unbent
his haughty lip and lit up his handsome face like
sunlight through a cloud; and it was evident he
thought more of Lilian Napier's bright blue eyes,
her innocence, and her fears, than the dangers and
ignominy to which coming day would assuredly
expose him.
</p>

<p>
The mildness, modesty, and beauty of the
young girl, with the touching artlessness of her
manner, had awakened a nearer and more vivid
interest in his heart, one to which it had hitherto
been utterly a stranger.  It was the dawn of
passion; never before, he thought, had one so
winning or so attractive crossed his path; he had
found at last the well-known face that his fancy
had conjured up in a thousand happy reveries,
and he was predisposed to love it.  Her tears and
affliction for the last relative (save one) whom
fate and war had left, had increased her natural
attractions, and a keen sense of her unmerited
humiliation, and the risk he ran for her, by
knitting their names together, all tended to raise a
glow in young Walter's solitary heart; for having
no living thing in this wide world to cling to, it
was peculiarly susceptible and open to impressions
of kindness and generosity; now it expanded
with a flush of happiness and delight to
which since thoughtless childhood it had been a
stranger; and in a burst of soldierlike enthusiasm,
he uttered her name aloud, and drained the
pewter flagon of Rhenish to the bottom.
</p>

<p>
As he set it down, a noise behind made him
turn sharply round and listen; nothing was visible
but the dark stains of the wainscotting, and its
gilded pannels glistening ruddily in the glow of
the fire.  From an antique brass sconce on the
wall, the light of three great candles burned
steadily on the old discoloured floor, the
massively jointed arch of the fire-place, which bore a
legend in Saxon characters, on three old pictures
by Jamieson, of cavaliers in barrelled doublets,
high ruffs, and peaked beards, and one of the
famous Barbara Napier of Bruntisfield, who so
narrowly escaped the stake for her sorceries, on a
spectral suit of mail, and six old heavily carved
chairs, ranged against the wall like grotesque
gnomes with their arms akimbo; but although
nothing was visible to create alarm, the aspect of
the chamber was so gloomy, that certain tales of a
spectre cavalier who haunted the old house, began
to flit through Walter's mind, and he could not
resist listening intensely; still not a sound was
heard, but the wind rumbling in the hollow vent,
and the creaking of the turret vanes overhead.
</p>

<p>
"Tush!" said he, and whether it was the faint
echo of his own voice or a sound again behind
the wainscot, he knew not, but he palpably heard
something that made him bring the hilt of his
long rapier more readily to hand.  The portraits,
like all those of persons whom one knows to have
been long dead, when viewed by the dim candle-light
had a staring, desolate, and ghastly expression,
and they really seemed to "frown" over
their high ruffs on the intruder, who would
probably have frowned in return, had he not, even
in the harsh lines of the old Scottish artist traced
a family likeness to the soft features of Lilian
Napier.  But there was a stern, keen and
malignant expression in the features of the old
sorceress, Lady Barbara, that made Walter often
avert his eyes, for her sharp features seemed to
start from the pannel instinct with life and
mockery.
</p>

<p>
As sleep weighed down the eyelids of Walter,
strange fancies pressed thick and fast, though
obscurely, on his mind; and though once or twice
the same faint hollow sound made him start and
take another survey of the apartment by the dim
light of the sconce and dying embers of the fire,
his head bowed down on the table, and at last he
slumbered soundly.
</p>

<p>
Scarcely had he sunk into this state when there
was a sharp click heard; a jarring sound succeeded,
and on the opposite side of the room, about three feet
from the ground, a pannel in the wainscotting was
opened slowly and cautiously, and the bright glare
of a large oil cruise streamed into the darkened
apartment.  Beyond the aperture, receded a gloomy
alcove or secret passage, into the obscurity of
which the steps of a narrow stair ascended, and
therein appeared the figure of a man, who gazed
cautiously upon the unconscious sleeper.  He was
about thirty years of age, strongly formed, and
possessing a handsome but very weatherbeaten
countenance.  He wore a plain buff coat and steel
gorget; his waist was encircled by a broad belt,
which sustained a pair of long iron pistols of the
Scottish fashion, and a sharp narrow-bladed
rapier glittered in his hand.
</p>

<p>
Young Fenton still slept soundly.
</p>

<p>
The stranger regarded him with a stern and
louring visage, on which the lurid light of the
upraised cruise fell strongly.  It betokened some
fell and deadly intention, and as the hostile ferocity
of its aspect increased as slowly, softly, and
ominously he descended into the apartment.
</p>

<p>
"Through which part of the iron shell shall I
strike this papistical interloper?" he muttered;
"I will teach thee, wretch, to think of Lilian
Napier in thy cups!"
</p>

<p>
His right hand was withdrawn preparatory to
making one furious and deadly thrust, which assuredly
would have ended this history (ere it is well
begun) had not the subject thereof started up
suddenly, exclaiming,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Back, rebel dog! on thy life, stand back!"
and striking up the thrust rapier, drew his own,
and throwing a chair between him and his
adversary, he stood at once upon his guard.
</p>

<p>
"Malediction!" cried the stranger, furiously,
"dolt that I was not to have pistolled thee from
the pannel!"
</p>

<p>
"Wemyss, Wemyss!" exclaimed Walter, "The
guard&mdash;what; ho! without there!"
</p>

<p>
"Spare your breath, for you may need it all,"
said the other, putting down his lamp, and barring
the door.  "This chamber is vaulted and boxed,
and long enough mayest thou bawl ere thy
fellow-beagles hear thee.  Defend thyself, foul minion
of the bloodiest tyrant that ever disgraced a throne.
Strike! for by the Heaven that is above, ere a
sword is sheathed, this floor must smoke with the
blood of one or both of us!  Come on,
Mr. Springald, and remember that you have the
honour to cross blades with the best swordsman in
the six battalions of the Scottish Brigade."
</p>

<p>
"You are&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ha, scoundrel!  Quentin Napier of Bruntisfield,
by God's grace and King William's, a
captain of the Scots-Dutch; so fall on, for I am
determined to slay thee, were it but to keep my
hand in practice for better work."
</p>

<p>
The blades crossed and struck fire as they
clashed; each cavalier remained a moment with
his head drawn back, the right leg thrown forward
and his eyes glaring on his antagonist.  Walter
was ten years younger than his adversary, upon
whom he rushed with more ardour than address,
and consequently, in endeavouring to pass his
point and close, received a slight wound on the
hand, which kindled him into a terrible fury.
Napier excelled him in temper, if not in skill; he
parried all his thrusts with admirable coolness,
until, perceiving that the youth's impetuosity
began to flag, he pressed him in turn, the
ferocity that sparkled in his eyes and blanched his
nether lip revealing the bitterness of his intention;
but in making one furious lunge, he overthrust
himself, and was struck down with his sword-hand
under him.  Rage had deprived Walter of all
government over himself; in an instant his knee
was on Napier's breast, and his sword shortened
in his hand with the intention of running him
through the heart, for his blood was now up, and
all "the devil" was stirred within him.  He felt
the deep broad chest of his powerful adversary
heaving beneath him with suppressed passion and
fury.
</p>

<p>
"Captain Napier," said Walter, "for the sake
of her whose name and blood you share&mdash;though
you disgrace them&mdash;I will spare your life if you
will beg it at my hands."
</p>

<p>
"Strike!" and he panted rather than breathed
as he spoke; "Strike! life would be less than
worthless if given as a boon by Dunbarton's
beggarly brat.  O, a thousand devils!&mdash;is it come to
this with me?"
</p>

<p>
"Peace, fool!" exclaimed Walter, "peace, lest
your words tempt me to destroy you.  Accept
life at my hands; they spared the blood of a better
man upon the field of Sedgemoor."
</p>

<p>
"Be it so," replied the discomfitted captain,
sullenly receiving his rapier; "I accept it only
that I may, at some future time, avenge in blood
the stain thou hast this night cast upon the best
cavalier of the Scottish Brigade."  He ground
his teeth.  "D&mdash;nation! my throat is burning&mdash;any
wine here?"  He drank some Rhenish from
a flask, and then continued, "Ho, ho, and now,
since you know my hiding-place, doubtless for the
sake of the thousand marks this poor brain-pan
is worth, ye will deliver me unto our Scottish
Phillistines&mdash;those Lords of Council, who are
steeped to the lips in infamy and blood!"
</p>

<p>
"Perish the thought!" replied Walter, sheathing
his rapier with a jerk.  "You are safe for me&mdash;and
here is my thumb on't."
</p>

<p>
"Gad so, young fellow, I love thy spirit, and at
another's expense could admire your skill in the
noble science of defence.  You fought at
Sedgemoor&mdash;so did I."
</p>

<p>
"For the King?"
</p>

<p>
"Why&mdash;not exactly."
</p>

<p>
"For James of Monmouth?"
</p>

<p>
"Humph!"
</p>

<p>
"Then doubly are you a branded rebel."
</p>

<p>
"I had been a glorious patriot, had we won that
bloody field.  Young fellow, you must have early
cocked your feather to the tuck of the drum!  Art
a Papist?"
</p>

<p>
"Nay, I am a good Protestant, I hope."
</p>

<p>
"And loyal to our Seventh James, the crowned
Jesuit?  Der tuyvel, as we say in Holland, 'tis a
miracle!" and after drinking from the wine-flask,
he resumed with greater urbanity, "When I
remember how you permitted the Lady Bruntisfield
and my kinswoman Lilian to escape, it
shames me that I was not more generous; but the
devil tempted me to blood in that infernal hole to
which I must return."
</p>

<p>
"Now, sir, since the ladies are gone, you will
undoubtedly starve."
</p>

<p>
"Nay, the whole household know of my concealment,
and old Drouthy will not let me want
for wine and vivres."
</p>

<p>
"They may inform."
</p>

<p>
"O never!  I am their lady's only kinsman&mdash;the
last of the good old line, and they are staunch
servitors; a few among those, whom the courtly
villany of these times hath left uncorrupted.  'Tis
well I know all the outlets of the mansion, for it
will become quite too hot for me after to-night.
No doubt a band of your soldiers will be here at
free quarters until the whole barony, outfield and
infield, are as bare as my hand."
</p>

<p>
"In part, you anticipate rightly."
</p>

<p>
"Henckers! then I must shift my camp among
our whig friends in the west until&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Until what?" asked Walter, suspiciously.
</p>

<p>
"Thou shalt learn anon, and so shall all thy
faction with a vengeance!" replied the captain,
while a deep smile spread over his features.
"Meantime adieu, and may God keep us separate,
friend!  I trust to thine honour."
</p>

<p>
"Adieu!"
</p>

<p>
He sprang into the secret passage, closed the
pannel, and Walter heard his footsteps dying
away as he ascended into the hollow recesses of
the thick wall, and sought some of those secret
hiding-places with which this ancient mansion
abounded more than any other edifice in or
around Edinburgh.
</p>

<p>
Morning came, and with it came an order from
the king's advocate to bring the prisoners before
the privy council, and to secure the persons of
their entire household for future examination and
thumb-screwing, if necessary.
</p>

<p>
The multiplied lamentations and exclamations
of fear and sorrow, which rang through the house
of Bruntisfield on the arrival of Macer Maclutchy,
with this terrible fiat (which he announced with
all the jack-in-office insolence peculiar to
himself), and the clank of musquets and din of high
words in the corridor or ambulatory, roused
Walter from a second short but sound sleep, and
starting, he raised his head from the table on
which he had reclined.
</p>

<p>
Redly and merrily the rays of the morning sun
rising above the oak woods streamed through the
grated window of the chamber, and threw a warm
glow on its dark-brown wainscotting.  It was a
sunny March morning, and the old oaks were
tossing their leafless branches on the balmy wind;
the black corbies cawed on their summits, and the
lesser birds twittered and chirped from spray to
spray; the clear sky was flecked with fleecy
clouds, and its pure azure was reflected in the still
bosom of the long and beautiful loch, that
stretched away between its wooded banks towards
the east, where the old house of Gilford and the
craigs of Salisbury closed the background.
</p>

<p>
Walter felt his bruises still smarting from the
recent struggle; he examined the place of his
fierce visitor's exit, but failed to discover the least
trace of it; every pannel fitted close, and was
immovable, for he knew not the secret.  The whole
combat appeared like a dream; but a scar on his
hand, a notch or two on his sword, and several
overturned chairs, still remained to attest the truth
of it.  Hastening to unfasten the door which
Quentin Napier had secured with such deadly
intentions, a little glove on the floor attracted his
eye.  He snatched it up.  It was very small, and
of richly worked lace, tied by a blue ribbon.
</p>

<p>
"She has worn this.  Oh, 'tis quite a prize,"
said the young man as he kissed it, and laughing
at himself for doing so, placed it within the top of
his corslet.
</p>

<p>
"My certie, here is a braw bit o' wark and a
bonnie!" exclaimed Macer Maclutchy, bustling
into the room.  "Here is an order from the
king's advocat to bring the leddies o' Bruntisfield
to the Laigh Council House instanter, and the
chamber o' dais is empty, toom as a whistle,&mdash;the
birds clean awa, and the gomeral that stood by
the door kens nae mair about them than an
unchristened wean.  My word on't, lads," he
continued flourishing his badge of office, "some here
maun kiss the maiden or climb the gallows for
last night's wark!"
</p>

<p>
After swearing an oath or two, which appeared
to give him infinite relief in his perplexity,
</p>

<p>
"Master Walter," said the old halberdier,
"here is a devilish piece of business&mdash;an
overslagh, as we used to say in Flanders.  Rot me!  I
have searched every place that would hold a
mouse, but the prisoners are not to be found!  I
have pricked with my dagger every bed, board,
and bunker, and so sure as the devil&mdash;make
answer, Halbert Elshender," he cried, shaking the
sentinel roughly by his bandoliers, "answer me,
or I will truncheon thee in such wise, thou shalt
never shoulder musket more.  Fause knave! where
are the prisoners over whom I posted ye?"
</p>

<p>
"A lang day's march on the road to hell, I
hope&mdash;the old one, at least," responded the
musqueteer, sullenly; "dost think I have them under
my corslet?"
</p>

<p>
"Faith!  General Dalyel will let ye ken, friend
Hab, that a thrawn craig or six ounce bullets are
the price Scottish of winking on duty.  Ye'll be
shot like a cock-patrick.  I pity thee, Hab&mdash;d&mdash;mme
if I don't; you've blawn your matches by
my side on many a hot day's work, and bleezed
away your bandoliers in the face o' English,
Dutch, and German; but my heart granes for the
punishment ye'll dree."
</p>

<p>
"You are all either donnart or drunk!"
exclaimed the incensed soldier; "if the ladies were
in the chamber when I first mounted guard, I
swear by my father's soul, they are there yet for
me.  I neither slept nor stirred from the door;
so they maun either have flown up the lum or
whistled through the keyhole&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Didst ever hear of a noble lady playing cantrips
o' witchcraft like a wife o' the Kailmercat,
or that auld whaislin besom, your mother, down
by St. Roque?"
</p>

<p>
"What for no?&mdash;it rins in the family, this same
science o' witchcraft, gif a' tales be true."
</p>

<p>
"See if such a braw story will pass muster
with Sir Thomas Dalyel.  Cocknails!  I think I
see every hair o' his lang beard glistening and
bristling with rage!"
</p>

<p>
"And he will mind that my father was a
staunch vassal o' the Napiers!" added the poor
musqueteer, in great consternation at the idea of
confronting that ferocious commander.  "What
can I do or say?&mdash;O help me, Master Walter!
Would to God I had been piked or shot at
Sedgemoor!"
</p>

<p>
"Wemyss," said Walter, advancing at this
juncture, just as the serjeant was unbuckling the
soldier's collar of bandoliers.  "The ladies are
gone where I hope none, save friends, will find
them.  Elshender is innocent, for I freed them,
and must bear the punishment for doing so; but
next time, comarade Hab, you take over such a
post, see that your wards are in it."
</p>

<p>
"I had your word, Mr. Fenton," replied the
musqueteer in a voice between sorrow and joy;
"your word at least in the sense, and we alway
deemed you a gentleman of honour, though but
a puir soldier-lad like mysel."
</p>

<p>
"True, true," replied Walter, colouring; "will
not the generosity of my purpose excuse the
deceit?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, Mr. Fenton, I wish weel to the auld
house, for I was born and bred under its shadow,
and mony o' my kin hae laid down their lives in
its service, and I can excuse it&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"D'ye think my Lord Chancellor will, though?"
asked the Macer sharply, as he bustled forward,
"or His Majesty's advocat for His Majesty's
interest?"
</p>

<p>
"Or Sir Thomas Dalyel o' the Binns?" added
the serjeant testily.  "O! what is this o't
noo&mdash;after I, from a skirling brat, had made a man and
a soldier of thee?  O! 'tis an unco scrape&mdash;a
devilish coil of trouble, and I wish you weel out
o't.  Retain your sword, my puir child, but
consider yourself under close ward until orders come
anent ye.  D&mdash;me!  I once marched three hundred
prisoners from Zutphen to French Flanders,
among them the noble Count of Bronkhorst himsel,
and never lost but one man whom I pistolled
for calling me a hireling Scot, that sold my king
for a groat, whilk I considered as a taunt
appertaining to the Covenanters alone.  Gowk and
gomeral, boy, what devil tempted thee to&mdash;&mdash;but
why ask?  Yon pawkie gipsey's blue een&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Hush!"
</p>

<p>
"Hae thrown a glamour owre ye.  Wherever
women bide, there will mischief be.  'Tis a
kittle job!  What a pumpkin-head I was not to
keep watch and ward mysel.  Rot me! a young
quean's skirling, or a carlin's greeting would hae
little effect on me, for I have heard muckle o' baith
in my time.  Did no thought of our Council prevent
ye running your head in the cannon's mouth?"
</p>

<p>
"No; I saw women in distress, Wemyss, and
acted as my heart dictated."
</p>

<p>
"Had they been two auld carlins with hairy
chins, gobber teeth, wrinkled faces, and hands like
corbies' claws, I doubt not your tender heart
would have dictated otherwise.  But when next I
set a handsome young lad to watch a young lass,
may the great de'il spit me, and mak my ain
halbert his toasting fork!"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, ay," muttered Macer Maclutchy, whose
jaws were busily devouring all the good things
he could collect in buffet or almrie; "auld
Hornie may do so in the end, whatever comes to
pass."
</p>

<p>
"O Willie Wemyss, Willie Wemyss!" quoth
the veteran halberdier apostrophizing himself;
"dark dool be on the hour that brings this
disgrace upon thee, after five and thirty years o'
hard and faithful service, under La Tour d'Avergne,
Crequy, Condé, and Dunbarton!  The deil's in
ye, Walter Fenton!  You were aye a moody
and melancholy cheild, and I ever thought ye were
born under some ill star, as the spaewives say."
</p>

<p>
"Braw spark though he be," said the Macer,
"he's come o' the true auld covenanting spawn,
Mr. Wemyss&mdash;and birds o' a feather&mdash;here's
luck, serjeant, and better times to us a'"; and so
saying he buried his flushed visage in a vast
flagon of foaming ale.

<h3>
CHAPTER VI.
<br /><br />
THE OLD TOLBOOTH.
</h3>

<p class="intro">
Whether I was brought into this world by the usual human
helps and means, or was a special creation, might admit of some
controversy, as I have never known the name of parent or of
kindred.&mdash;THE IMPROVISITORE.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Many of the citizens of Edinburgh may remember
the old Bank close, and the edifice about
to be described.  On the west side of that
narrow street, which descended abruptly on the
southern side of the city's central hill, stood in
former days a house of massive construction and
sombre aspect.  Its walls were enormously thick
and elaborately jointed; its passages narrow, dark,
and devious; its stairs ascended and descended in
secret corners, and one led to the paved bartizan,
which formed the roof.  Many of its gloomy
chambers were vaulted.  Over its small and heavy
doorway appeared the date 1569, encrusted by
smoke and worn with time.  The whole aspect of
the edifice was peculiarly dismal; the walls were
black as if coated over with soot, the windows
were thickly grated with rusted iron stanchells,
and sunk in massive frames, the little panes were
obscured by the dust and cobwebs of years.
</p>

<p>
It was the ancient prison of the city.  In older
days it had been built by a rich citizen named
Gourlay, and had held within its walls the
ambassadors of England and France.  From its
strength it had been converted into a Tolbooth,
and was used as such until the time of the Solemn
League and Covenant, when the spacious and more
famous prison was adopted for that purpose;
but the older, darker, more obscure, and more
horrid place of confinement was still used at this
time.
</p>

<p>
A party of the ancient City Guard, armed with
swords and Lochaber axes, buff coats, and steel
bonnets, occupied one of the lower apartments
entering from the turnpike stair, at the foot of
which stood a sentinel with his axe, before the
door, which though small, was a solid mass of
iron-studded oak, bolts and long bars.
</p>

<p>
In a small but desolate chamber of this striking
old edifice&mdash;the same in which the hapless Earl
of Argyle passed the night of the 29th June, 1685,
his last in the land of the living&mdash;Walter Fenton
was confined a prisoner, while the Reverend
Mr. Ichabod Bummel, Mr. Drouthy the butler, and
other servitors of Lady Bruntisfield, were in close
durance in the greater or upper Tolbooth.  The
roof, the walls, and the floor of this squalid
apartment were all of squared stones, stained with
damp and scrawled over with hideous visages,
pious sentences, and reckless obscenity.  Its only
window was thickly grated within and without,
and there in the sickly light the busy spiders
spun their webs from bar to bar in undisturbed
industry.  It opened to a narrow, dark, and steep
Close of dreary aspect; the opposite houses were
only one yard distant, and ten stories high; the alley
was like a chasm or fissure; a single ray of sunlight
streamed down it, and penetrating the cobwebs
and dust of the prison window, radiated through
its deep embrasure, and threw the iron gratings in
strong shadow on the paved floor.  Though the day
was a chill one, in March, there was no fire under
the small archway, where one should have been,
and the only articles of furniture were a coarse
and heavy table like a carpenter's bench, a
miserable palliasse on a truckle bedstead, and a water
flagon of Flemish pewter.  One or two rusty
chains hung from enormous blocks in the dirty
walls, for the more secure confinement of prisoners
who might be more than usually dangerous or
refractory, and the whole tout ensemble of the
chamber when viewed by the dim and fast-fading
light of the evening was cheerless, desolate, and
disgusting.
</p>

<p>
The day had passed away, and now, divested
of his gay accoutrements, and clad in a plain
unlaced frock of grey cloth, the young prisoner
awaited impatiently, perhaps apprehensively, the
hour that would bring him before that terrible
council whose lawless will was nevertheless the
law of the land.  Sunk in moody reverie, he
remained with his arms folded, and his head sunk
forward on his breast.
</p>

<p>
The shadow of the grating on the floor grew
less and less distinct, for as the light faded, his
vaulted prison became darker, until all became
blackness around him.  Anon the pallid moon
rose slowly into its place, and from the blue
southern sky poured a cold but steady flood of
silver light into the cheerless room, and again, for
a time, the shadow of the massive grating was
thrown on the discoloured floor.  All around it
was involved in obscurity, from amid which the
damp spots on the walls seemed like great and
hideous visages, mocking and staring at the
captive.
</p>

<p>
Bitter were the thoughts, and sad the memories
that thronged fast upon the mind of Walter
Fenton; his dark eyes were lit, his lip
compressed, but there were none to behold the
changes; his handsome features were alternately
clouded by chagrin, contracted by anger, and
softened by love.  Though ever proud in spirit, and
fired by an inborn nobility of soul, never until
now did he feel so keenly the dependence of his
situation, or so fierce a longing for an opportunity
when by one brilliant act of heroism and courage,
he might place himself for ever above his fortune,
or&mdash;die.  And Lilian!  O it was the thought of
her alone that raised these vivid aspirations to
their utmost pitch; but his heart sank, and even
hope&mdash;the lover's last rallying point&mdash;faded away
when he pictured the difference of their fortunes
and positions in life.  Scotland was then a
country where pride of birth was carried to excess;
and a remnant of that feeling still exists among
us.  He reflected that he was poor and nameless,
compelled from infancy to eat the bread of
dependence and mortification, and now in manhood,
having no other estate than his sword and a ring,
which, as he had often told Lilian with a smile
(and he knew not how prophetically he spoke)
"contained the secret of his life:" she the
representative of a long line of illustrious barons,
whose shields had shewn their blazons on the
fields of Bannockburn, Sark, and Arkinholme,
the inheritrix of their honours, their pride, and
their possessions.  Poor Walter! but he was too
thoroughly in love to lose courage altogether.
</p>

<p>
As a boy, he had sighed for Lilian, and he felt
his enthusiasm kindled by her gentleness and
infantile beauty, for then his heart knew not the
great gulf which a few years would open up
between them.  The ardour of his temperament
made him now feel alternately despair and hope&mdash;but
the latter feeling predominated, for though
the clergy railed at wealth and all the good things
of this life, and took peculiar care to enjoy a good
share thereof&mdash;the world was not so intensely
selfish then as it is now, for a high spirit and a
bold heart, when united to a gallant bearing, a
velvet cloak, a tall feather, and a long sword,
were valued more than an ample purse by the
young ladies of that age, who were quite used to
find in their ponderous folio romances, how
beautiful and disinterested queens and princesses
bestowed their hands, hearts, and kingdoms on those
valiant knights-errant and penniless cavaliers,
who alone, or by the aid of a single faithful squire,
freed them from enchanted castles, and slew the
wicked enchanters, giants, gnomes, and
fire-vomiting dragons who had persecuted them from
childhood.
</p>

<p>
To resume: poor Walter was intensely sad, for
deeply at that moment he experienced the desolate
feeling, that he was utterly alone in this wide
world, and that within all its ample space there
existed not one being with whom he could
claim kindred.  He felt that it was all a blank, a
void to him; but his thoughts went back to those
days when the suppression of the rising at Bothwell,
struck terror and despair into the hearts of
the Presbyterians, and filled the dungeons of the
Scottish castles, and the Tolbooths of the cities
with the much-enduring adherents of the Covenant,
beneath the banner of which his father was
supposed to have died with his sword in his hand&mdash;so
with her dying lips had his mother told him,
and his heart swelled and his eye moistened, as he
recalled the time, the place, and her tremulous
accents, with a vivid distinctness that wrung his
breast with the tenderest sorrow, even after the
lapse of so many years.
</p>

<p>
During the summer of 1679 those citizens of
Edinburgh, whose mansions commanded a view of
the Grey friars kirkyard, beheld from their
windows a daily scene of suffering such as had never
before been seen in Scotland.
</p>

<p>
This ancient burial-place lies to the south of
the long ridge occupied by the ancient city; it is
spacious, irregular, and surrounded by magnificent
tombs, many of them being of great antiquity,
and marking the last resting-places of those who
were eminent for their virtues and talents, or
distinguished by their birth.  It is a melancholy place
withal.  For three hundred years never a day has
passed without many persons being interred there;
and the hideous clay, the yellow and many-coloured
loam, that had once lived and breathed, and loved
and spoken, has now risen several feet above the
adjacent street, against the walls of the great old
church in the centre, and has buried the
basements of the quaint and dark monuments that
surround it.  The inscriptions and grotesque
carving of the latter, have long since been
encrusted and blackened by the smoke of the city, or
worn and obliterated by the corroding and fetid
atmosphere of the great grave-yard.  There is not
a spot in all the Lothians where the broad-leaved
docken, the rank dog-grass, the long black nettle,
and other weeds grow so luxuriantly, for terrible
is the mass of human corruption, for ever festering
and decaying beneath the verdant turf.
</p>

<p>
In the year before mentioned, this ancient city
of the dead was crowded to excess with those
unhappy non-conformists whom the prisons could
not contain, for already were their gloomy
dungeons and squalid chambers filled with the poor,
the miserable, and devoted Covenanters.  Strong
guards and chains of sentinels watched by day
and night the walls of the burial-ground; and
then the buff-coated dragoon, with his broadsword
and carbine, and the smart musqueteer, with his
dagger and matchlock, were ever on the alert to
deal instant death as the penalty of any attempt
to escape.  The rising at Bothwell had been
quenched in blood; and these unhappy people
had been collected&mdash;principally from Bathgate&mdash;by
the cavalry employed in riding down the
country, and being driven like a herd of cattle to
the capital, were penned up in the old churchyard.
And there, for months, they lay in hundreds,
exposed to the scorching glare of the sun
by day, and the chill dew by night&mdash;the rain and
the wind and the storm!  God's creatures, formed
in his own image, reduced to the level of the hare
and the fox, with no other canopy than the
changing sky, and no other bed than the rank
grass, reeds, and nettles, that sprung in such
hideous luxuriance from the fetid graves beneath
them.
</p>

<p>
It was a sorrowful sight; for there was the
strong and athletic peasant, with his true Scottish
heart of stubborn pride and rectitude, his weak
and tender wife with her little infants, his aged
and infirm parents.  Their miseries increasing as
day by day their numbers diminished, and other
burial-mounds, fresh and earthy, rose amid the
hollow-eyed survivors to mark the last homes of
other martyrs in the cause of "the oppressed
Kirk and broken Covenant."  And all this terrible
amount of mental misery and bodily suffering
was accumulated within the walls of the capital,
amid the noisy and busy streets of a densely
peopled city&mdash;and for what?  Religion&mdash;religion,
under whose wide mantle so many thousand atrocities
have been committed by men of every creed
and age; and because these poor peasants had
resolved to worship God after the spirit of their
own hearts, and the fashion of their fathers.
</p>

<p>
When the Duke of Albany and York (afterwards
James VII.) came to Edinburgh, the persecution
was not continued with such rigour; but
the progress of time never overcame the
resolution of the covenanters, though many noble
families were reduced to poverty, exile, and ruin,
while their brave and moral tenantry suffered
famine, torture, imprisonment, and every severity
that tyrannical misgovernment could inflict, until
the Presbyterians were driven to the verge of
despair; intrigues with the Prince of Orange
were set on foot, and for some years a storm had
been gathering, which, in the shape of a Dutch
invasion, was soon to burst over the whole of
Britain.
</p>

<p>
Walter's memory went back to those days,
when, amid the tombs and graves of that old
kirk-yard, he had nestled, a little and wailing
child, on the bosom of his mother, who,
imprisoned there among the "common herd," had soon
sunk under the combined effects of exposure,
starvation, degradation, and sorrow; and he
remembered when coiled up within her mantle
and plaid, how he hid his little face in her fair
neck, trembling with cold and fear in dreary
nights, when the moon streamed its light between
the flying clouds upon the vast and desolate
church and its thick grave-mounds, with the long
reedy grass waving on their solemn and melancholy
ridges.
</p>

<p>
A mystery hung over the fortune of Walter
Fenton.  Of his family he knew nothing further
than that his mother's name was Fenton, and his
own was Walter, for so she had been wont to call
him.  Of his father he knew nothing, save that
he had never been seen since the cavalry of
Claverhouse swept over the Bridge of Bothwell,
scattering its defenders in death and defeat.  He
had heard that his father there held high command,
but was supposed to have perished either in the
furious <i>mêlée</i> on the bridge, or in the stream
beneath it.  Concealing her rank in the disguise
of a peasant, his mother had been found in the
vicinity of the battle-field, was arrested as a
suspected person, sent to Edinburgh, and imprisoned
with other unfortunates in the old church-yard.
</p>

<p>
Poor Walter used to remember with pleasure
that they had always remained aloof from the
other prisoners, and were treated by them with
marked respect.  Their usual shelter was under
the great mausoleum of the Barons of Coates, the
quaint devices and antique sculpture of which had
often raised his childish fear and wonder; he
recalled through the struggling and misty perceptions
of infancy, how day by day her fair features
became paler and more attenuated, her eye more
sunken and ghastly, her voice more tremulous
and weak, and her strength even less than his
own; for (he had heard the soldiers say) she had
been a tenderly nurtured and fragile creature,
unable to endure the hardships to which she was
subjected; and so she perished among the first
that died there.
</p>

<p>
One morning the little boy raised his head from
the coarse plaid which on the previous night her
feeble hands had wrapped around him, and called
as usual for her daily kiss; he twisted his dimpled
fingers in the masses of her silky hair, and laid
his smiling face to hers&mdash;it was cold as the marble
tomb beside them; he shrank back, and again
called upon her, but her still lips gave no reply;
he stirred her&mdash;she did not move.  Then, struck
by the peculiar, the terrible aspect of her pale
and once beautiful face, the ghastly eyes and
relaxed jaw, the child screamed aloud on the
mother that heard him no more.  He dreaded
alike to remain or to fly; for, alas! there was no
other in whose arms he could find a refuge.
</p>

<p>
A soldier approached.  He was a white-haired
veteran, who had looked on many a battle-field,
and speaking kindly to the desolate child, he
gently stirred the dead woman with his halberd.
</p>

<p>
"Is this thy mother, my puir bairn?" said he.
</p>

<p>
The child answered only by his tears, and hid
his face in the grass.
</p>

<p>
"Come away with me, my little mannikin,"
continued the soldier, "for thy mother hath gone
to a better and bonnier place than this."
</p>

<p>
"Take me there too," sobbed the child, clinging
to the soldier's hand; "oh, take me there too."
</p>

<p>
"By my faith, little one, 'tis a march I am not
prepared for yet&mdash;but our parson will tell you all
about it.  Tush!  I know the flams of the drum
better than how to expound the text; so come
away, my puir bairn; thy mother, God rest her,
is in good hands, I warrant.  Come away; and
rot me, if thou shalt want while old Willie
Wemyss of the Scots' Musqueteers, hath a bodle
in his pouch, or a bannock in his havresack."
</p>

<p>
By the good-hearted soldier he was carried
away in a paroxysm of childish grief and terror;
and he saw his mother no more.
</p>

<p>
By the beauty of her person, the exceeding
whiteness of her hands, and a very valuable ring
found with her, she was supposed to be of higher
rank than her peasant's attire indicated; and those
apparent proofs of a superior birth, the soldiers
never omitted an opportunity of impressing upon
Walter as he grew older; and cited innumerable
Low Country legends and old Scottish traditions,
wherein certain heroes just so circumstanced, had
become great personages in the end; and Walter
was taught to consider that there was no reason
why he should be an exception.  But <i>who</i> his
mother was, had unfortunately remained locked in
her own breast; whether from excessive debility
and broken spirit she lacked strength to
communicate with the other captives, or whether she
feared to do so, could not be known now; her
secret was buried with her, and thus a mystery
was thrown over the fortune of the little boy,
which through life caused him to be somewhat of
a moody and reflective nature.
</p>

<p>
William Wemyss, a veteran serjeant of Dunbarton's
musqueteers, became his patron and protector;
and a love and friendship sprang up
between them, for the orphan had none other to
cling to.  Wemyss often led him to the old
churchyard, and showed him the grave where his mother
lay&mdash;where the soldiers had interred her; and
there little Walter, overcome by the mystery that
involved his fate, and the loneliness of his heart,
wept bitterly; for the soldier, though meaning
well, was rather like one of Job's comforters, and
painted his dependance in such strong colours,
and reminded him how narrowly he had escaped
being hanged or banished as "a covenanter's
spawn," that the heart of the poor boy swelled
at times almost to breaking.  Then the soldier
would desire him to pray for his mother, and
made him repeat a curious but earnest prayer full
of quaint military technicalities, in which the good
old halberdier saw nothing either unusual or outré.
Often little Fenton came alone to seek that well-known
grave, to linger and to sit beside it, for it
was the only part of all broad Scotland that his
soul clung to.  The weeds were now matted over
it, and the waving nettles half hid the humble
stone, which with his own hands the kind soldier
had placed there.  Walter always cleared away
those luxuriant weeds, and though they stung his
hands, he felt them not.  It was a nameless grave
too, for the real name of her who slept within it
was unknown to him; and the desolate child
often stretched himself down on the turf, burying
his face in the long grass, and weeping, as he
had done in infancy on the poor bosom that
mouldered beneath, retraced in memory, days
of wandering and misfortune, of danger and
sorrow, which he could not comprehend.  Time, and
that lightness of heart which is incident to youth,
enabled him at last to view the grave with
composure; but he sought it not the less, until after
his return from Sedgemoor; he hastened to the
well-known place, but, alas! the grave had been
violated, and the charm of grief was broken for
ever.  <i>Another</i> had been buried there; the earth
was freshly heaped up; and he rushed away, to
return no more.
</p>

<p>
From childhood to youth the old Serjeant was
his only protector: though poor, he was a kind
and sincere one; and the little boy became the
pet of the musqueteers.
</p>

<p>
A child, a dog, or a monkey is always an object
of regard to an old soldier or sailor; for the
human heart must love something.
</p>

<p>
Little Walter carried the halberdier's can of
egg-flip when he mounted guard, learned to make
up bandoliers of powder, polish a corslet, to
rattle dice on a drumhead, and to beat on the
drum itself; to fight with rapier and dagger; to
handle a case of falchions like any sword-player;
and became an adept at every game of chance,
from kingly chess, to homely touch-and-take.  He
learned to drink "Confusion to the Covenant,"
in potent usquebaugh without winking once, and
swear a few cavalier-like oaths.  Like all such
pets, he was often boxed severely, and roundly
cursed too, at the caprice of his numerous
masters, until the poor boy would have been
altogether lost, his ideas corrupted, and his manners
tainted by the roughness of camp and garrison,
had not his humble patron been ordered away on
the Tangier expedition; and being unable to take
his little protégé with him, bethought him of
craving the bounty of his commander's wife, the
Countess of Dunbarton, a beautiful young English
woman, who was the belle of the capital and
the idol of the Scottish cavaliers.  Struck with
the soldier's story, envying his generosity, pitying
the little boy, and pleased with his candour and
beauty, she immediately took him under protection,
adopting him as her page; and never was
there seen a handsomer youth than Walter Fenton,
when his coarse attire (a cast doublet of the
serjeant) was exchanged for a coat of white velvet
slashed with red and laced with gold, breeches
and stockings of silk, a sash, a velvet cloak, and
silver-hilted poniard; and his dark-brown hair
curled and perfumed by Master Peter Pouncet,
the famous frizzeur in the Bow.  He parted in a
flood of tears from his old patron, who slipped
into his pocket a purse the Countess had bestowed
on himself, drew his leather glove across his eyes,
and hurried away.
</p>

<p>
At Lady Dunbarton's he had often seen Lilian
Napier; she was then a little girl, and always
accompanied her tall and stately relative in the
vast old rumbling coach, with its two footmen
behind and outriders in front, armed with sword
and carbine; for the noble dame set forth in
great state on all visits of ceremony.  Lady
Grizel's majestic aspect and frigid stateliness
scared and awed the little footpage; but the
prattle of the fair-haired Lilian soothed and
charmed him, and he soon learned to love the
little girl, to call her his sister, to be joyous when
she came, and to be sad when she departed.
</p>

<p>
Young Walter, from his well-knit figure, and a
determined aspect which he had acquired by his
camp education, was as great a favourite among
the starched little damoiselles of the Countess's
withdrawing-room, as his clenched fist and bent
brows made him a terror at times to the little
cavaliers whose jealousy he excited; and his
military preceptors (the old Royals, then battling and
broiling at Tangiers) had inculcated a pugnacity
of disposition that sometimes was very troublesome;
and he once proceeded so far as to d&mdash;n
the old Dowager of Drumsturdy pretty roundly,
and draw his poniard on the young lord her son,
who, with his companions, had mocked him as "a
covenanter's brat."  The Countess made him
crave pardon of the little noble, and they shook
hands like two cut-and-thrust gallants of six feet
high.
</p>

<p>
But when their companions, with childish
malevolence, taunted poor Walter as "my lord's
loon," "the soldier's varlet," or "the powder
puggy," epithets which always kindled his rage
and drew tears from his eyes, Lilian, ever gentle
and kind, wept with him, espoused his cause, and
told that "Walter's mother was a noble lady, for
the Countess had her ring of gold;" and the
influence of the little nymph, with her cheeks like
glowing peaches, and her bright hair flowing in
sunny ringlets around a face ever beaming with
happiness&mdash;was never lost, or failed to maintain
peace among them.  And thus days passed swiftly
into years, and the girl was twelve and the boy
sixteen when they were separated.  Walter
followed his noble patron to the field, when the
landing of Argyle in the west, and Monmouth in
the south, threw Britain into a flame.  Dunbarton,
now a general officer, marched with the
Scottish forces against the former; but Walter, as
a volunteer, served under Colonel Halkett, with a
battalion of Scottish musqueteers, at the battle of
Sedgemoor, where he felt what it was to have lead
bullets rebounding from his buff coat and
headpiece.  Since then he had been serving as a
private gentleman; but in a country like
Scotland, swarming with idle young men of good birth
and high spirit, who despised every occupation
save that of arms, preferment came not, and he
had too often experienced the mortification of
seeing others obtain what he justly deemed his
due, the commission of King James VII.
</p>

<p>
His recent interview with Lilian had recalled in
full force all the friendship of their childhood and
the dawning love of older years; but the manner
in which he was now involved with the supreme
authorities seemed to destroy all his hopes for
ever&mdash;in Scotland at least; and yet, though that
reflection wrung his heart, so little did he regret
the part he had acted, that for Lilian's sake he
would willingly run again, a hundred-fold greater
risk.  The last three years of his life had been
spent amid the stirring turmoil of military duty
in a discontented country, where each succeeding
day the spirit of insurrection grew riper.  In the
rough society with which he mingled, never had
he been addressed by a female so fair in face and
so winning in manner as Lilian of Bruntisfield;
and thus the charm of her presence acted more
powerfully upon him.  Her accents of entreaty
and distress&mdash;her affection for Lady Grizel
struggling with anxiety for himself, had in one brief
interview recalled all the soft and happy impressions
of his earlier and more innocent days, and
love obtained a sway over his heart, that made
him for a time forget his own dangerous
predicament, in pondering with pleasure on the
mortifications from which he had saved the ladies of
Bruntisfield, the risks he had run for their sake,
and consequently the debt of gratitude they owed
him.
</p>

<p>
From his breast he drew forth her glove a
hundred times, to admire its delicate texture and
diminutive form; but he could not repress a bitter sigh
when contemplating how slight were the chances
of his ever again beholding the gentle owner, now
when both unhappily were under the ban of the
law,&mdash;she a homeless fugitive, and he a close
prisoner, with death, imprisonment, or distant service
in the Scots' Brigade his only prospects.  Even
were it otherwise,&mdash;and, oh! this idea was more
tormenting than the first,&mdash;her heart might be
dedicated to another; and she might, with the
true pride of a noble Scottish maiden, deem it an
unpardonable presumption in the poor and
unhonoured pikeman to raise his eyes to the heiress
of Sir Archibald Napier of Bruntisfield and the
Wrytes.  And thus, having introduced to the
reader the grand feature upon which our story
must "hinge," we shall get on with renewed
ardour.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII.
<br /><br />
THE LAIGH COUNCIL HOUSE.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Ye holy martyrs, who with wond'rous faith,<br />
  And constancy unshaken have sustained<br />
  The rage of cruel men and fiery persecutions;<br />
  Come to my aid and teach me to defy<br />
  The malice of this fiend!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TAMERLANE.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The moon had passed westward; the close was
gloomy as a chasm; and Walter's prison became
dark as a cave in the bowels of a mountain.  The
clank of chains and bars as the door was opened
roused the prisoner from his waking dreams; a
yellow light flashed along the heavily jointed stone
walls, and the harsh unpleasant voice of Macer
Maclutchy cried authoritatively&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Maister Walter Fenton!&mdash;now, then, come
forth instanter.  Ye are required by the Lords of
the Privy Council."
</p>

<p>
A thrill shot through Walter's heart: he endeavoured
in vain to suppress it, and, taking up his
plain beaver hat, which was looped with a ribbon
and cockade à la Monmouth in the military fashion,
he descended the narrow spiral stair, preceded by
the macer carrying his symbol of office on his
right shoulder, and attired in a long flowing black
gown.  Two of the Town-guard, with their pole-axes,
and Dunbraiken their captain,&mdash;a portly
citizen, whose vast paunch, cased in corslet and
backpiece, made him resemble a mighty tortoise
erect,&mdash;kept close behind; and thus escorted,
Walter set out from his prison, to appear before a
select committee of the dreaded Privy Council of
Scotland.
</p>

<p>
Encumbered by his long official garb, Macer
Maclutchy's step was none of the most steady.
He was evidently after his evening potations at
Lucky Dreeps; he wore his bonnet cocked well
forward; and such a provoking smirk of vulgar
importance pervaded his features when, from time
to time, he surveyed his prisoner, that the latter
was only restrained by the axes behind from
knocking him down.
</p>

<p>
In those days the hour of dinner was about one
or two o'clock; but as the Earl of Perth, the
Lords Clermistonlee, Mersington, and others
loved their wine too well to leave it soon for dry
matters of state, and the thumbscrewing of witches
and non-conformists, the evening was far advanced
before Walter Fenton was summoned for examination
in the Laigh Chamber, where the Council
held their meetings under the Parliament Hall, in
a dark and gloomy region, where lights are always
burned even yet during the longest days of
summer.
</p>

<p>
Passing a narrow pend or archway (where, in
the following year, the Lord President Lockhart
was shot by Chiesly of Dairy), Walter and his
conductors issued into the dark and deserted
Lawnmarket, passed the Heart of Midlothian,
from the western platform of which, the black
beam of the gibbet stretched its ghastly arm in
the moonlight,&mdash;and reached the antique Parliament
Square, a quadrangle of quaint architecture,
which had recently been graced by a beautiful
statue of Charles II.  On one side rose the
square tower and gigantic façade of St. Giles, with
its traceried windows, its rich battlements and
carved pinnacles all glittering in the moonlight,
which poured aslant over several immense piles of
building raised on Venetian arcades, and made all
the windows of the Goldsmiths' Hall glitter with
the same pale lustre that tipped the round towers
of the Tolbooth, the square turrets and circular
spire of the Parliament House, the whole front of
which was involved in opaque and gloomy shadow,
from which the grand equestrian statue of King
Charles, edged by the glorious moonlight, stood
vividly forth like a gigantic horseman of polished
silver.
</p>

<p>
The square was silent and still, as it was black
and gloomy.  A faint chorus stole on the passing
wind, and then died away.  It came from the
hostel, or coffee-house, of Hugh Blair, a famous
vintner, whose premises were under the
low-browed and massive piazza before mentioned.
The deep ding-dong of the cathedral bell, vibrating
sonorously from the great stone chambers of the
tower, made Walter start.  It struck the hour of
nine, and, save its echoes dying away in the hollow
aisles and deep vaults of the ancient church, no
other sound broke the silence of the place; and
Walter felt a palpable chill sinking heavily on his
spirit, when, guided by the macer, they penetrated
the cold shade of the quadrangle, and by a richly
carved doorway were admitted into the lobby of
the house, which was spacious and lofty enough to
be the hall of a lordly castle.  From thence
another door gave admittance into that magnificent
place of assembly where once the estates of
Scotland met&mdash;
</p>

<p>
  "Ere her faithless sons betrayed her."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Its rich and intricate roof towered far away into
dusky obscurity; its vast space and lofty walls of
polished stone echoed hollowly to their footsteps;
and the bright moon, streaming through the
mullioned and painted windows, threw a thousand
prismatic hues on the oaken floor, on the
grotesque corbels, and innumerable knosps and gilded
pendants of its beautiful roof,&mdash;on the crimson
benches of the peers,&mdash;on the throne, with its
festooned canopy,&mdash;on the dark banners and darker
paintings, bringing a hundred objects into strong
relief, sinking others in sombre shadow, and
tipping with silver the square-bladed axes and
conical helmets of the Town-guardsmen as they
passed the great south oriel, with its triple
mullions and heraldic blazonry.
</p>

<p>
From thence steep, narrow, and intricate stairs
led them to the regions of the political Inquisition,
and the wind that rushed upward felt cold and
dewy as they descended.  At the bottom there
branched off a variety of stone passages, where
flambeaux flared and cressets sputtered in the
night wind, and cast their lurid light on the dusky
walls.  And now a confused murmur of voices
announced to the anxious Fenton that he was
close to this terrible conclave, whose presence few
left but on the hurdle of the executioner.
</p>

<p>
In an anteroom a crowd of macers, city guardsmen,
messengers-at-arms, and officials in the blue
livery of the city, laced with yellow, and wearing
the triple castle on their cuffs and collars, a
number of persons cited as witnesses, &amp;c., lounged
about, or lolled on the wooden benches.  The
ceiling of the apartment was low, and the deep
recesses of the doors and windows showed the vast
solidity of the massively panelled walls.  A huge
fire blazed in a grate that resembled an iron basket
on four sturdy legs, and its red light glinted on
the varied costumes, the weather-beaten visages,
polished headpieces and partisans of those who
crowded round it.  The entrance of Walter Fenton
and his escort excited neither attention nor
curiosity; and feeling acutely his degraded position,
he sought a retired corner, and seated himself on
a wooden bench.  The groups around him
conversed only in whispers.  A murmur of voices
came at intervals from the inner chamber; and
Walter often gazed with deep interest at its
antiquely fashioned doorway, the features of which
remained long and vividly impressed on his
memory; for he longed to behold, but dreaded to
encounter, the stern conclave its carved panels
concealed from his view.
</p>

<p>
Anon a cry&mdash;a shrill and fearful cry&mdash;announced
that some dreadful work was being enacted
within; every man looked gravely in his neighbour's
face, (save Maclutchy, who smiled,) and
the blood rushed back on Walter's heart tumultuously.
Deep, hollow, and heart-harrowing groans
succeeded; then were heard the sound of hammers
and the creaking of a block as when a rope runs
rapidly through the sheave; then a low murmur of
voices again, and all was still; so still, that Walter
heard the pulsations of his heart, and in spite of
his natural courage, it quailed at the prospect of
what he too might have to undergo.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the door of the dreaded chamber flew
open, and the common Doomster and his two
assistants, with their muscular arms bared, and
their leather aprons girt up for exertion, issued
forth, bearing the half lifeless and wholly
miserable Ichabod Bummel.  His countenance was
pale and ghastly; his teeth were clenched, and his
eyes set; his limbs hanging pendant and powerless,
bore terrible evidence of the agonies caused
by the iron boots, as his fingers, covered with
blood, did of the thumb-screws.  He groaned
heavily.
</p>

<p>
"What has the gallows loon confessed, Pate?"
asked Maclutchy, eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"Sae muckle, that the pyets will be pyking his
head on the Netherbow-porte when the sun rises
the morn," replied Mr. Patrick Pincer, the heartless
finisher of the law, whose brawny arms and
blood-stained apron, together with all the disgusting
associations of his frightful occupation rendered
him a revolting character.  "He defied the haill
council as a generation o' vipers; boasted o' being
a naturalized Hollander, and denied his ain
mother-country."
</p>

<p>
"Wretch!" muttered Bummel, "well might I
deny the land that produces such as thee.  But
there is yet a time, and in Heaven is all my
trust."
</p>

<p>
"Silence in court!" said the macer, imperiously
thrusting the brass crown of his baton in the
sufferer's mouth.  "Ay, ay, denying his ain
country, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Till my Lord Clermistonlee recommended a
touch o' the caspie-claws, and wow, Sirs, the loon
stood them brawly, but when we gied him a
twinge wi' the airn buits, my certie! they did mak'
him skirl!  Did ye no hear him confessing, lads?"
</p>

<p>
"What! what?"
</p>

<p>
"Ou just onything they asked him.  Treason,
awfu' to hear; about a Dutch invasion and a
rebellion among the Westland whigs, to whom he
shewed letters from Flume o' Polwarth, Fagel the
Pensioner o' Holland, Dyckvelt the Flemish spy,
and a' hidden whar d'ye think?"
</p>

<p>
"Deil kens; in his wame, may be."
</p>

<p>
"Hoots; sewit up in the lining o' his braid
bonnet."
</p>

<p>
The poor fainting preacher had now the felicity
of being stared at by a crowd who pitied him no
more than the strong-armed torturers whose
grasp sustained his supine and inert frame.
</p>

<p>
"Soldier," said he to one near him, "art thou
a son of the Roman antichrist?"
</p>

<p>
"Na, I am Habbie, the son o' my faither, auld
John Elshender, a cottar body, at the Burghmuirend."
</p>

<p>
"Then, in the name of God," implored the
poor man in a weak and wavering voice, "give me
but a drop o' water to quench my thirst, for, oh
youth, I suffer the torments of hell!"
</p>

<p>
The soldier who seemed to be a good-natured
young fellow, readily brought a pitcher of water,
from which Bummel drank greedily and convulsively,
muttering at intervals,
</p>

<p>
"'Tis sweet&mdash;sweet as aqua-coelestis, whilk is
thrice rectified wine.  Heaven bless thee, soldier,
and reward thee, for I cannot."  He burst into
tears.
</p>

<p>
"Hath he taken the test," asked Maclutchy,
"and did he acknowledge the king's authority?"
</p>

<p>
"Ou onything, and so would you, Maclutchy,
gif I had ye under my hand as I'll soon hae that
young birkie in the corner."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis false!" cried Ichabod Bummel, through
his clenched teeth, "and sooner than acknowledge
that bloody and papistical duke, I would kiss, yea,
and believe the book of the accursed Mohamet,
whilk as I shew in my '<i>Bombshell aimit at the
taile of the great Beast</i>,' was written on auld
spule banes, and kept by the gude wife of the
impostor in a meal girnel.  But fie! and out
upon ye, fiends, for lo, the hour of our triumph
and deliverance from tyrants and massemongers
is at hand.  O, why tarry the chariot wheels of
our Deliverer?"
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "I like ane owl in desart am,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That nightly&mdash;&mdash;"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"What!" exclaimed Maclutchy, in legal horror,
"would ye dare to skirl a psalm within earshot o'
the very Lords o' Council, ye desperate cheat,
the woodie!  Awa wi' him by the lug and horn,
or he'll bring the roof about us."  He was
hurried off.
</p>

<p>
Walter was deeply moved.  Pity and indignation
stirred his heart by turns, but he had not
much time for reflection; at that moment the
drawling voice of the crier was heard, calling with
a cadence peculiar to the Scottish courts,
</p>

<p>
"Maister-Walter-Fenton."
</p>

<p>
He became more alive to his own immediate
danger, and ere he well knew what passed, found
himself in another gloomy and pannelled
apartment, one-half of which was hung with scarlet
cloth.  On a dais stood the vacant throne with
the royal arms of Scotland glittering under a
canopy of velvet, festooned and fringed with gold.
</p>

<p>
Scott has given us a graphic picture of this
strange tribunal, when it was presided over by
the odious Duke of Lauderdale.  Let us take a
view of it as it appeared six years after, when that
scourge of the Presbyterians had departed to
render at a greater bar an account of his tyranny
and enormities.

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><br />
THE PRIVY COUNCIL.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  'Tis noble pride withholds thee&mdash;thou disdain'st<br />
  Wrapt in thy sacred innocence&mdash;these mad<br />
  Outrageous charges to refute.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SCHILLER'S MAID OF ORLEANS.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
A long table, covered with scarlet cloth,
extended from the throne towards the end of the
room where Walter stood.  Large, red-edged, and
massively gilded statute books, docquets of papers,
inkstands, and the silver mace (now used by the
Lords of Session), lay glittering on the table,
while a large silver candelabrum, with twelve tall
wax lights, shed a lustre on the striking figures of
those personages who composed the select committee
of council.
</p>

<p>
On a low wooden side-bench lay certain fearful
things, which (in his present predicament) made
the heart of Walter quail; though on the field he
would have faced, without flinching, the rush of a
thousand charging horse; they were the instruments
of torture then authorised by law; the
<i>pilnie-winks</i>, the <i>caspie-claws</i>, and the <i>iron-boots</i>&mdash;all
diabolical engines, such as the most refined
cruelty alone could have invented.  With these,
both sexes, even little children were sometimes
tortured until the blood spouted from the bruised
and crushed limbs.
</p>

<p>
The thumbikins were small steel screws like
handvices, which, by compressing the thumb-joints,
produced the most acute agony; and this
amiable and favourite engine (which saved all
trouble of cross-examining witnesses), was first
introduced by one of the council, whose stern
eyes were fixed on Walter Fenton, Lieutenant-General
Sir Thomas Dalyel of Binns, a cavalier
baronet of great celebrity, whose name is still
justly abhorred in Scotland.  He had long borne
a command under the Russian standard, where his
humanity had not been improved by service
among Tartars and Calmucks.
</p>

<p>
The boot was a strong box enclosed with iron
hoops, between which and the victim's leg, the
executioner, by gradual and successive blows,
drove a wooden wedge with such violence, that
blood, bone, and marrow were at last bruised into
a hideous and pulpy mass.
</p>

<p>
Walter could scarcely repress a shudder when
he surveyed those frightful engines, under the
application of which, so many unfortunates had
writhed; but he confronted with an undaunted
air the various members of that stern tribunal,
which had so long ruled Scotland by the sword,
and many of whose acts and edicts might well vie
with those of the Inquisition, the Star-chamber,
or any other instrument of tyranny and
misgovernment.
</p>

<p>
Two earls, Perth, the Lord Chancellor, and
Balcarris, the High Treasurer, were present; they
were both fine-looking men, in the prime of life,
richly dressed, and wearing those preposterous
black wigs (brought into fashion by Charles II.),
the ends of which rolled in many curls over their
broad collars of point lace.  The Bishop of
Edinburgh, the Lord Advocate, and his predecessor,
the terrible Sir George Mackenzie, of Rosehaugh,
"that persecutor of the saints of God;"&mdash;(he
whose tomb was, till of late years, a place so full
of terror to the schoolboy,) occupied one side of
the council-board.  Opposite sat John Grahame,
of Claverhouse, colonel of the Scottish life-guards,
the horror of the Covenanters, (and to this hour
the accursed of the Cameronians,) but the
handsomest man of his time.  His face was singularly
beautiful, and his black, magnificent eyes, were
one moment languid and tender as those of a
love-sick girl, and the next sparkling with dusky
fire and animation.  When excited, they actually
seemed to blaze, and were quite characteristic of
his superhuman daring and unmatched ferocity.
</p>

<p>
Cruel as the character of the Laird of Claverhouse
has ever been held up to us, let us not
forget the times in which he lived, and how much
room there is for malevolent exaggeration.  Even
Wodrow allows that at times he showed
compunction, mercy, and compassion.  Mutual
injuries, assassinations, and outrages heightened the
hostility of spirit between the Scottish troops and
the Scottish people to a frightful extent; but it is
a curious fact, that the local militia and vassals of
the landholders were, by far, the most severe tools
of persecution.  The <i>real</i> sentiments of the troops
of the line, were powerfully evinced by their
joining <i>en masse</i> the banner of the Protestant invader.
In making these remarks, let it not be thought
we are attempting to gloss over the atrocities of
the persecution, the records of which are enough
to make one's blood boil even at this distant
period of time.  The darkest days of our history
are those of which the industrious Wodrow wrote;
but glorious indeed was the ardour and constancy
with which so many of Scotland's best and bravest
men gave up their souls to God in the cause of
the "oppressed kirk and the broken covenant."
</p>

<p>
Claverhouse was splendidly attired; his coat
was of white velvet, pinked with scarlet silk and
laced with gold; over his breast spread a cravat
of the richest lace, and on that fell the heavy
dark ringlets of his military wig.  Near him sat
Sir Thomas Dalyel, colonel of the Scots grey
dragoons.  This fierce soldier was in the eightieth
year of his age; he was perfectly bald, and a lofty
forehead towered above his keen grey eyes, that
shone brighter than his polished gorget in the
light of the candelabrum.  To his stern features
a noble and dignified aspect was imparted by a
long white beard, that flowed over his plain buff
coat, reaching to the buckle of his sword-belt.
There was a very striking and antique expression
in the fine face of the aged and detested 'persecutor,'
that never failed to impress beholders with
respect and awe.
</p>

<p>
There are but two others to describe, and these
are of some importance to our history.
</p>

<p>
Swinton, of Mersington, a law lord, who was
never known to have been perfectly sober since
the Restoration, and whose meagre body, nutcracker
jaws, bleared eyes, and fantastic visage,
contrasted so strongly with the upright and square
form of the venerable cavalier on his right, and
the dignified Randal, Lord Clermistonlee, who
sat on his left.
</p>

<p>
A renegade Covenanter, a profligate, and
debauched roué, steeped to the lips in cruelty,
tyranny, and vice, the latter, after having
squandered away a noble patrimony and the dowry of
his unfortunate wife, still maintained his career of
excess by gifts from the fines, extortions, and
confiscations, made by the Council on every
pretence, or without pretence at all.  He was forty
years of age, possessing a noble form, and a face
still eminently handsome, though marked by
dissipation; it was slightly disfigured by a sword
cut, and, notwithstanding its beauty of contour,
when clouded by chagrin and ferocity, and flushed
by wine, it seemed that of a very ruffian, and now
was no way improved by his ample wig and cravat
being quite awry.  His dark vindictive eyes were
sternly fixed on Walter, who, from that moment,
knew him to be his enemy.  Clermistonlee, who
was not a man to have his purposes crossed by
any mortal consideration, had long marked out
fair Lilian Napier as a new victim to be run-down
and captured.  Her beauty had inflamed his
senses, her ample possessions his cupidity&mdash;it was
enough; his wrath, and perhaps his jealousy,
were kindled against the young man by whose
agency she had found concealment, after he
thought all was <i>en train</i> by his accusing the
Baroness of Bruntisfield to the Council, and
procuring a warrant of search and arrest for
inter-communed persons at her Manor of the
Wrytes-house.  His brows were contracted until they
formed one dark arch across his forehead; one
hand was clenched upon the table, and the other
on the embossed hilt of his long rapier, which
rested against his left shoulder, and there was no
mistaking the glance of hostility and scrutiny he
bent upon the prisoner.  The other members of
the Council were all highly excited by the
revelations recently extracted from Mr. Ichabod Bummel
(by dint of hammer and screw), concerning the
intrigues of the whigs with the Prince of Orange.
The letters of the exiled Baron of Polwarth, and
of Mynheer Fagel, the Great Pensionary of
Holland, were lying before the Lord Chancellor, who
played thoughtfully with the tassels of his rapier,
while his secretaries wrote furiously in certain
closely-written folios.  Several clerks, macers,
and other underlings who loitered in the
background, were now ordered to withdraw.
</p>

<p>
"Approach, Walter Fenton," said the Earl of Perth.
</p>

<p>
"Fenton," muttered General Dalyel, "'tis a
name that smacks o' the auld covenant; I hanged
a cottar loon that bore it, for skirling a psalm at
the foot o' the Campsie Hills, no twa months ago."
</p>

<p>
"And of true valor, if we remember the old
Fentons of that ilk, and the brave Sir John de
Fenton of the Bruce's days," continued the
chancellor.  "Young man, you of course know for
what you this night compear before us?"
</p>

<p>
"My Lord, for permitting the escape of
prisoners placed under my charge."
</p>

<p>
"Prisoners charged with treason and leaguing
with intercommuned enemies of the state!" added
Clermistonlee, in a voice of thunder.
</p>

<p>
"And you plead guilty to this?"
</p>

<p>
"I cannot deny it, my Lords."
</p>

<p>
"Good&mdash;you save the trouble of examining
witnesses."
</p>

<p>
"A bonnie piece o' wark, young Springald!"
said General Dalyel scornfully; "a braw beginning
for a soldier&mdash;but ken ye the price o't?"
</p>

<p>
"My life, perhaps, Sir Thomas," replied Walter,
gently; "yet may it please you and their
Lordships to pardon this, my first offence, in
consideration of my three years' faithful and, as yet,
unrequited service.  Heaven be my witness, noble
sirs, I could not help it!"
</p>

<p>
"By all the devils!  Help what, thou fause loon!"
</p>

<p>
"Permitting the escape of Lady Bruntisfield and
her kinswoman, the young lady."
</p>

<p>
"Aha! the young lady!" laughed Claverhouse
and Balcarris.
</p>

<p>
"I was overcome by their terror and entreaties.
Oh, my Lords, I seek not to extenuate my offence."
</p>

<p>
"Plague choke thee!" said Dalyel, with a grim
look; "a braw birkie ye are, and a bonnie to
wear a steel doublet&mdash;a fine chield to march to
battle and leaguer, if ye canna hear a haveral
woman greet, but your heart maun melt like
snaw in the sunshine.  By the head of the king,
ye shall smart for this!  Sic kittle times thole nae
trifling."
</p>

<p>
"I doubt not the young fellow was well paid
for his untimely gallantry," said Clermistonlee,
with a provoking sneer.
</p>

<p>
"Any man who would insinuate so much, I
deem a liar and coward!" said Walter, fearlessly:
the eyes of the Privy Councillor shot fire; he
started, but restrained himself, and the young
man continued.  "No, my Lord Clermistonlee! though
poor, I have a soul above bribery, and
would not for the most splendid coronet in
Scotland change sides, as <i>some</i> among us have done,
and may do again."
</p>

<p>
"Silence!" replied Clermistonlee, in a voice
of rage, for he writhed under this pointed remark,
having once been a staunch covenanter; "silence,
rascal, and remember that on yonder bench there
lieth a bodkin of steel, for boring the tongue that
wags too freely."
</p>

<p>
"Enough of this," said the Chancellor, striking
the table impatiently with his hand; "Mr. Secretary,
attend, and note answers.  Walter Fenton,
you are doubtless well aware of where the ladies
of Bruntisfield are concealed, and can enlighten
us thereon."
</p>

<p>
"I swear to you, most noble Earl, that I know not!"
</p>

<p>
"Ridiculous!" said his tormenter, Clermistonlee,
who was under the influence of wine.  "Say
instantly, or by all the devils, if there is any
marrow in your bones, we shall see it shortly:" with
his gold-headed cane he significantly touched the
iron boots that lay near.
</p>

<p>
"Hath he been searched according to the act
of council, whilk ordains,&mdash;sae forth," said
Mersington; "for some of Madam Napier's perfumed
carolusses may be found in his pouch."
</p>

<p>
"Nothing was found on him, my Lord," replied
Maclutchy, "save a sang or twa, a wheen
gun matches, twa dice, a wine bill o' Hughie
Blair's&mdash;the Council's orders to the
Forces&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And what, Sir?"
</p>

<p>
"A few white shillings, my Lord."
</p>

<p>
"Whilk ye keepit, I suppose."
</p>

<p>
The macer scratched his head and bowed.
</p>

<p>
"Whence got ye that ring, sirrah?" asked the
imperious Clermistonlee, suddenly feeling a new
qualm of jealousy.
</p>

<p>
"Ring, my Lord, ring!" stammered Walter,
colouring deeply.
</p>

<p>
"Yea knave, it flashed even now, and by this
light seems a diamond of the purest water.  A
common pikeman seldom owns a trinket such as
that."
</p>

<p>
"I cry-ye-mercy," said Dalyel; "had your
Lordship seen my brigade of Red Cossacks
retreating after the sack of Trebizond and Natolia,
ye would have seen the humblest spearman with
his boots and holsters crammed to the flaps with
the richest jewels of Asiatic Turkey.  I mysel
borrowed a string of pearls from an auld Khanum,
worth deil kens how mony thousand roubles.
Gad! some pretty trinkets fall in a soldier's way
at times."
</p>

<p>
"Sir Thomas," said Claverhouse, "I would
we had a few troops of your Cossacks, to send
among the wrest-land whigs for six months or so."
</p>

<p>
"S'death!" said the General, through his massy
beard, "your guardsmen think themselves fine
rufflers, and so they are, Clavers'e, but I doubt
muckle if in a charge they would have come within
o' spear's length of my Red Brigade.  Puir chields! lang
since hae they stuffed the craps of the wolves
and vultures that hovered oure the bluidy plains
of Smolensk."
</p>

<p>
"Well, my Lords, about this ring," observed
Clermistonlee, with ill-disguised impatience, while
endeavouring to waken His Majesty's advocate,
who, oblivious of "His Majesty's interest," had
fallen fast asleep.  "We all know that the Lady
Bruntisfield has a god-daughter, grand-niece, or
something of that kind&mdash;a fair damsel, however;
and 'tis very unlikely this young cock would run
his neck under the gallows (whereon I doubt not
his father dangled) for nothing.  Fenton&mdash;harkee,
sirrah, surrender the jewel forthwith, and say
whence ye had it, or the thumbscrews may prove
an awkward exchange for it."
</p>

<p>
"Do with me as you please, my Lords, but ah! spare
me the ring.  It is the secret of my life&mdash;it
is all that I possess in the world&mdash;all that I can
deem my own:" pausing with sudden emotion
the young man covered his eyes.  "It was found
on the hand of my mother&mdash;my poor mother,
when she lay dead among the graves of the Grey
Friars."
</p>

<p>
"When, knave?"
</p>

<p>
"In the year of Bothwell."
</p>

<p>
A cloud came over the face of Clermistonlee.
</p>

<p>
"In the year of Bothwell, my Lords," continued
Walter, in a thick voice; "that year of misery to
so many.  I have been told my father died in
defence of the bridge; and my mother&mdash;she&mdash;spare
to me, my Lords, what even the poor soldiers
who found me respected!  It was preserved and
restored to me by the good and noble Countess of
Dunbarton when, three years ago, I marched
against James of Monmouth."
</p>

<p>
"The true pup of the crop-eared breed!" said
Clermistonlee, scornfully; "false in blood as in
name.  Macer, hand up the ring!  His mother
(some trooper's trull) never owned a Jewell like
that."
</p>

<p>
The macer advanced, but hesitated.
</p>

<p>
"Approach, wretch, and, by the God that
beholds us, I will destroy thee!" cried Fenton,
inflamed with sudden passion; and so resolute was
his aspect, that Maclutchy retreated, and now
Mersington and the king's advocate, who had been
snoring melodiously, woke suddenly up.
</p>

<p>
"My Lords, you trifle," said the Earl of Perth.
</p>

<p>
"Halt, sirs!" added Claverhouse, who admired
Walter's indomitable spirit; "I cannot permit
this; let the lad retain his ring, but say, without
parley, where those fugitives are concealed."
</p>

<p>
"On the honour of a soldier, I solemnly
declare to you, Colonel Grahame, that I know not."
</p>

<p>
"It is enough," responded Claverhouse, whose
deep dark eyes had gazed full upon Walter's with a
searching expression which few men could endure.
"Never saw I mortal man who could look me
openly in the face, when affirming a falsehood."
</p>

<p>
"This is just havers," said Mersington; "jow
the bell for Pate Pincer to gie him one touch of
the boot."
</p>

<p>
"My Lords, you may tear me piecemeal, but I
cannot tell ye; and, were it otherwise, I would
rather die than betray them!"
</p>

<p>
"Hush!" whispered Claverhouse, who admired
his spirited bearing; but Clermistonlee exclaimed
in triumph,
</p>

<p>
"Heard ye that, my Lords, heard ye that?
Gadso! a half acknowledgment that he can enlighten
us anent the retreat of these traitresses,
and I demand that he be put to the question!"
</p>

<p>
Now ensued a scene of confusion.
</p>

<p>
"Aye, the boot!" said Rosehaugh, Mersington,
and one or two others.  "Let him be remanded
to the Water Hole&mdash;the caspie claws."
</p>

<p>
"My Lords, I protest&mdash;" said Claverhouse,
starting up abruptly.
</p>

<p>
"Hoity toity!" said Mersington; "here's the
Laird of Claverse' turned philanthropist!  Since
when did this miracle take place?"
</p>

<p>
"Since the cold-blooded atrocities this chamber
has witnessed&mdash;" began Claverhouse, turning his
eyes of fire on the law lord; but the entrance of
Pincer and his two subaltern torturers, whom
that little viper, Mersington, had summoned, cut
short the observation.  Walter's blood grew
cold&mdash;his first thought was resistance&mdash;his second,
scorn and despair.
</p>

<p>
"Had the noble Earl of Dunbarton, or all our
blades, the old Royals, been in Edinburgh instead
of being among the westland whigs, ye had not
dared to degrade me thus!" he exclaimed, with
fierce indignation.  "I disclaim your authority,
and appeal to a council of war&mdash;to a court of
commissioned officers!"
</p>

<p>
"Uds daggers!" said Dalyel, "I love thee, lad.
Thou art a brave fellow, and the first man that
ever bearded this council board."
</p>

<p>
"But we will teach thee, braggart," said Sir
George of Rosehaugh sternly, "that from this
chamber there is no appeal, either to courts of
peace or councils of war.  There can be no
appeal&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Save to his majesty," added the Chancellor,
who, to please James VII., had recently embraced
the Catholic faith.
</p>

<p>
"And of what value is the appeal, noble Earl,
after one's bones have been ground to powder by
your accursed irons?'
</p>

<p>
"We do not sit here to bandy words in this
wise," replied the Chancellor; "Macer, lead the
prisoner to the ante-room, while his sentence is
deliberated on."
</p>

<p>
After a delay of some minutes, which to Walter
seemed like so many ages, so great was his
anxiety, he was again summoned before the
haughty conclave.  The first whose malignant
glance he again encountered was Clermistonlee,
whose voice he had often heard in loud declamation
against him, and he felt a storm of wrath and
hatred gathering in his breast against that
vindictive peer.  The monotonous voice of the clerk
reading his sentence with a careless off-hand air
now fell on his ear.
</p>

<p>
"Walter Fenton, private gentleman in the
regiment of Dunbarton, commonly called the
Royal Scots Musqueteers of Foot, for default and
negligence of duty&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Anent whilk it is needless to expone,"
interposed Mersington.
</p>

<p>
"&mdash;And for your contumacy in presence of the
Right Honourable the Lords of His Majesty's
Privy Council, you are to be confined in the
lowest dungeon of the common prison-house of
Edinburgh, for the space of six calendar months
from the date hereof, to have your tongue bored by
the Doomster at the Tron-beam, to teach it the
respect which is due to superiors; and thereafter
to be sent as a felon, with ane collar of steel
rivetted round your neck, to the coal heughs of
the right worshipful the Laird of Craigha' for
such a period as the Lords of the said Privy
Council shall deem fitting&mdash;subscribitur Perth."
</p>

<p>
"Such mercy may ye all meet in the day of
award!" muttered Walter.
</p>

<p>
"Withdraw!" said Lord Clermistonlee, with a
bitter smile of undisguised ferocity and malice.
"Begone, and remember to thank Sir Thomas of
Binns and the Laird of Claverhouse, that your
tongue is not bored this instant, and thereafter
given to feed the crows."
</p>

<p>
Walter bowed, and was led out by the macer,
while the council proceeded to "worry" and
terrify the remaining prisoners, Lady Bruntisfield's
household, and, after nearly scaring them out of
their senses, dismissed them all, (save two stout
ploughmen, who were given to Sir Thomas Dalyel
as troopers,) with warning to take care of
themselves in all time coming, and with a promise of a
thousand marks if they gave intimation of their
lady's retreat.

<h3>
CHAPTER IX.
<br /><br />
DEJECTION.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  A mournful one am I, above whose head,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A day of perfect bliss hath never passed;<br />
  Whatever joys my soul have ravished,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon was the radiance of those joys o'ercast.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LAYS OF THE MINNESINGERS.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Walter was conducted back to the prison-house
in Gourlay's Close, the Heart of Mid Lothian
being already filled with nonconforming
culprits.
</p>

<p>
Preceded by Macer Maclutchy and the gudeman
or governor of the establishment, who wore
the city livery, blue, laced with yellow, and carried
a bunch of ominous-like keys.  Walter found
himself before a little archway, closed by a strong
iron door, which opened under the great turnpike
stair of the edifice, and led to the lower
regions&mdash;to a superstructure of vaults, which, from their
low and massive aspect, might have been deemed
coeval with the days of the Alexanders.  The
light of the iron cruise borne by the gudeman
failed to penetrate the deep abyss which yawned
before them on the door being opened, and the
cold wind of the subterranean chambers rushed
upward in their faces.  Slowly descending the
hollowed and time-worn steps of an ancient stair,
accompanied by his guard and conductors, poor
Walter moved mechanically: the lamp, as it flared
in the chill atmosphere, shewed the dark arches
and green slimy walls of massive stonework
forming the basement story of the prison.  He felt
a horror creeping over his heart.  A profound
and dismal silence reigned there; for these earthy
passages where the frog croaked, the shining
beetle crawled, and the many-legged spider span
in undisturbed security, gave back no echo to their
footsteps.  In the heart of a populous city, thought
he, can such a place be?  Is it not a dream?
</p>

<p>
"Adonai!  Adonai!" cried a voice in the distance,
so loud, so shrill, and unearthly, that the
gudeman paused, and the macer started back.
"How long, O Lord, wilt thou permit these
dragons to devour thy people?  Rejoice, ye bairns
of the Covenant!  Rejoice, O ye nations, for He
will avenge the blood of his chosen, and render
vengeance on his adversaries."
</p>

<p>
"Hoots!  It's that fule-body Bummel blawing
like a piper through the key-hole," said the
macer, and knocking thrice on the cell door with
his mace, added, "Gif your tongue had been bored
with an elshin as it deserved, my braw buckie, ye
wadna hae crawn sae crouse.  However, gudeman,
his rebellious yammering will not disturb you
muckle."
</p>

<p>
"The vaults are gey far doon&mdash;we would be
deeved wi' him else," replied the gudeman; "but
he gangs to the Bass in the morning, and there he
can sing psalmody to the roaring waves and the
cauld east wind, wi' Trail, Bennet, Blackadder,
and other brethren in tribulation."
</p>

<p>
"By my word, keeping thae chields on the
auld craig is just feeding what ought to be
hanged," responded the macer, for these underlings
affected to acquire the cavalier sentiments
of the day.  A door was now opened, and Walter
Fenton heard the voice of the gudeman saying,
</p>

<p>
"Kennel up there, my man.  You will find
the lodgings we gie to conventiclers and enemies
of the king are no just as braw as Gibbie
Runlet's, doon at the White Horse.  There is a
windlan o' gude straw in that corner to sleep on,
gif the rottons, and speeders, and asps, will let
ye, and a mouthfu' o' caller air can aye be got at
the iron grate, and sae my service t'ye."
</p>

<p>
"And keep up your spirits, Mr. Fenton,"
added the macer with a mock bow, "for the
toun smith, Deacon Macanvil, will be doun in
the morning to rivet round your craig the collar
o' thrall wi' Craighall's name on't, and sae my
service t'ye too."
</p>

<p>
The sneers of these wretches stung Walter to
the soul, and it was with difficulty he restrained
an impulse to rush upon them and dash their
heads together.  But the door was instantly
closed; he heard the jarring of the bolts as they
were shot into the stonework, the clank of a chain
as it was thrown across, and then the retreating
footsteps of his jailors growing fainter as they
ascended the circular staircase.  A door closed
in the distance, the echoes died away, and then
all became intensely still.  He was now left
utterly to his own sad and mortifying reflections,
amid silence, gloom, and misery.
</p>

<p>
The darkness was oppressive; not the faintest
ray of light could be traced on any side, and he
wondered how the chill March wind swept through
the vault, until, on groping about, he discovered
on a level with his face, a small barred aperture,
which opened to the adjoining close.  In that
high and narrow alley there was but little light
even during the day; consequently, by night, it
was involved in the deepest obscurity.
</p>

<p>
The cold, damp wind blew freely upon
Walter's flushed face and waving hair, as he
moved cautiously round his prison, and feeling
the dark slimy walls on every side, discovered
that it was a vault about twelve feet square, faced
with stone, destitute, damp, frightful, and
furnished only by a bundle of straw in a corner.  On
this he threw himself, and endeavoured to reflect
calmly upon the perils by which he was surrounded.
</p>

<p>
He was naturally of an ardent and impetuous
temper, and consequently his reflections failed
either to soothe or to console him.  His
sentiments of hostility to Lord Clermistonlee were
equalled only by those of gratitude to the Laird
of Claverhouse, by whose influence he had, for a
time, been spared a cruel and degrading
maltreatment; but that, alas! was yet to be endured,
and the contemplation of it was maddening.  To
be given as a bondsman or serf, girt with a collar
of thrall or slavery, to work in the pits and mines
of certain landholders, was a mode of punishment
not uncommon in those vindictive days.
</p>

<p>
When the Scottish troops, under Lieutenant-colonel
Strachan, defeated the brave cavaliers of
Montrose in battle at Kerbister, in Ross, on the
27th of April, 1650, hundreds who were taken
captive were disposed of in that manner.  Some
were given in thrall to Lieutenant-general Lesly,
many to the Marquis of Argyle, others to Sir
James Hope, to work as slaves in his lead mines,
and the residue were all sent to France, to recruit
the Scottish regiments of the Lord Angus and
Sir Robert Murray.
</p>

<p>
Had his sentence been banishment to a foreign
service, though it would have wrung his heart to
leave his native country, and forego for ever the
bright hopes and visions that had (though afar off)
begun to lighten the horizon of his fortunes, he
would have hailed the doom with joy; but to be
gifted as a slave to another, to drudge amid the
filth, obscurity, and disgrace of a coal mine,
O! he looked forward to that with a horror
inconceivable......
</p>

<p>
His mind became filled with dismal forebodings
for the future.  Though he still remembered with
sincere pleasure the services he had rendered to
the Napiers of Bruntisfield, his dreams of Lilian's
mild blue eyes and glossy ringlets were sadly
clouded by the perils to which they had hurried
him.
</p>

<p>
All these proud and high aspirations, those
intense longings for fame and distinction, for
happiness and power, in which the mind of an
ardent and enthusiastic youth is so prone to
luxuriate, and which had been for years the day
dream of Walter Fenton, now suffered a chill
and fatal blight.  It is a hard and bitter conviction,
that one's dearest prospects are blasted and
withered for ever; and to the heart of the young
and proud, there is no agony equal to that of
unmerited disgrace and humiliation.  Misery was
Walter's companion, and further miseries and
degradations awaited him; but happily, the dark
future was involved in obscurity.

CHAPTER X.
<br /><br />
HOPE.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Thou art most fair; but could thy lovely face<br />
  Make slavery look more comely? could the touch<br />
  Of thy soft hand convey delight to mine<br />
  With servile fetters on.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BOADICEA, ACT IV.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Three days passed away.  Three, and still
there was no appearance of the dreaded Deacon
Macanvil with his hammer and rivets, and collar
of thrall.
</p>

<p>
The monotony of the prison had been unbroken
save, each morning, by the entrance of the
gudeman of the Tolbooth and a soldier of the
Townguard, bearing a wooden luggie of fresh water and
a slice of coarse bread, or coarser oaten cake on
a tin trencher, and to these poor viands, the
gudewife of the keeper, moved with pity for
"such a winsome young man," added a cutlet or
two on the third day.  For the first four-and-twenty
hours this mean fare remained untouched,
but anon, the cravings of a youthful appetite
compelled him to regale on it.
</p>

<p>
In a retired, or rather, a darker corner of this
miserable place, he reclined on his truss of damp
straw, listening to the lively hum of the city
without, and the deep ding-dong of the Cathedral
bells as they marked the passing hours.
</p>

<p>
Slowly the interminable day wore on.
</p>

<p>
Shadows passed and repassed the wretched
aperture which was level with the pavement, and
served for a window.  Feet cased in white funnel
boots garnished with scarlet turnovers, gold spurs
and red morocco spur leathers, in clumsy
Cromwellian calf-skins, or in brogues of more humble
pretensions, appeared and disappeared as the
passengers strode up and down the close; and
many pretty feet and taper ancles in tight
stockings of green or scarlet silk set up on
"cork-heeled shoon," tripped past, the fair owners
thereof displaying, by their uplifted trains, rather
more than they might have done, if aware that a
pair of curious eyes were looking upward from the
Cimmerian depth of that ghastly vault.  Bare-footed
children gambolled about in the spring
sunshine; with ruddy and laughing faces they
peeped fearfully into the dark hole, and on
discerning a human face through the gloom, cried
"a bogle, a ghaist!" and fled away with a shout.
</p>

<p>
Propped on his staff, the toiling water-carrier
passed hourly, conveying limpid water from the
public wells, even to the lofty "sixteenth story,"
for a bodle the measure.  Lumbering sedans were
borne past by liveried carriers at a Highland trot;
and the voices that rang perpetually in the narrow
alley, though enlivening the prison of Walter,
only served to make his sense of degradation and
captivity more acute.
</p>

<p>
Anon, all those sounds ceased one by one; the
bells of evening tolled, the ten o'clock drum was
beat around the ancient royalty, and died away in
the depths of Close and Wynd, and night and
silence stole together over the dense and lofty
city.  The last wayfarer had gone to his home,
and a desolate sense of loneliness fell upon the
heart of Walter Fenton.
</p>

<p>
"Alas, alas!" he exclaimed, "had my dear
friend Lady Dunbarton been on this side of the
border, I had not been thus persecuted and
forgotten.  And Finland, why tarries he?  Friendship
should bring him to me, for shame cannot
withhold him; I have committed no crime."
</p>

<p>
So passed the fourth day.
</p>

<p>
Night came on again, and the poor lad felt an
oppression of spirit, a longing for freedom, and
abhorrence of his dungeon; so bitter and intense,
that reflection became the most acute torment.
He turned restlessly among the straw, its very
rustle fretted him, and he started up to pace to
and fro in the narrow compass of the vault.  He
muttered, moaned, and communing with himself,
pressed his face against the rusty grating, while
listening intently to catch a passing sound, and
inhale the cool fresh breeze of the spring night.
</p>

<p>
Though so many thousand souls were densely
packed within the fortifications of Edinburgh, and
every house was like a beehive or a tower of
Babel, at that hour the city was still as the grave.
Walter heard only the throbbing of his heart.
The last dweller in the close had long since
traversed the lofty stair that ascended to his home;
the heavy door at the foot of the Prison turnpike
stair had long since been closed, and its sentinel
had withdrawn to smoke a pipe or sip a can of
twopenny by the gudeman's well-sanded ingle.
From the hollow recesses of its great rood spire
St. Giles's bell tolled eleven.
</p>

<p>
"Another night!&mdash;another&mdash;another!" exclaimed
Walter, as he threw himself upon the
straw, and wrung his hands in rage, in bitterness,
and unavailing agony.  "Another night!&mdash;Oh, to
be taught patience, or to be free!"
</p>

<p>
From a sleepy stupor that had sunk upon him,
the very torpidity of desperation, he was roused
by a noise at the grating: a face appeared dimly
without, and a well known voice said,
</p>

<p>
"Harkee, Fenton,&mdash;art asleep, my boy?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Me voila</i>&mdash;I am here!" he exclaimed, as he
sprang to the grating and pressed the hand of his
friend.
</p>

<p>
"You forget, Walter, that I am not calling the
roll," laughed the officer; "but <i>me voila</i> is very
old fashioned, my lad, and hath not been used by
us these two hundred years, since the battle of
Banje en Anjou.  By all the devils, 'tis a deuced
unpleasant malheur this!"
</p>

<p>
"I thought you had forgotten me, Finland."
</p>

<p>
"You did me great injustice; but, lackaday,
with Wemyss and my party I have been for
these three days worrying all the old wives and
bonnetted carles on the Bruntisfield barony, to
take certain obnoxious tests under terror of
thumbscrews and gunmatch.  By my honour, I
would rather that my lord, the Earl of Perth,
would march with his mace on shoulder, anent
such dirty work, for I aver that it is altogether
unbecoming the dignity and profession of a
soldier.  And mark me, Walter, all this tyranny
will end in a storm such as the land hath not
seen, since our father's days, when the banner
of the covenant was unfurled on the hill of
Dunse."
</p>

<p>
"And are there no tidings of Dunbarton, our
commander?"
</p>

<p>
"The deuce, no! there hath been no mail from
London these fourteen days; the rascal who
brought the bag had only one letter, and getting
drunk, lost it in the neutral grounds, somewhere
on the borders.  The earl was to have taken
horse at Whitehall for the north, on the first of
this month; 'tis now the penult day only, and he
cannot be here for a week yet, so patience,
Walter."  Walter sighed.
</p>

<p>
"There are others here who have not forgotten
thee, my dear Mr. Fenton," said a soft voice, as a
pretty female face, lighted by two bright eyes,
stooped down to that hideous grating.  "But,
forsooth, our good friend the Laird of Finland,
seems resolved to talk for us all, which is not to
be borne.  I think he has acquired all the loquacity
of the French chevaliers, without an atom of
their gallantry."
</p>

<p>
"A thousand moustaches!" stammered the
officer; "my fair Annie, I had almost&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Forgotten me! you dare not say so; but O
my poor boy Fenton, how sorry I am I see thee
there."
</p>

<p>
"I thank you, Mistress Laurie, but the honour
of this visit would gild the darkest prison in
Scotland&mdash;even the whig-vault of Dunoter," said
Walter, kissing the hand of the speaker, whom he
knew to be the betrothed of his friend, a gay and
lively girl of twenty, whose beauty was then the
theme of a hundred songs, of which, unhappily,
but one has survived to us&mdash;the effusion of
Finland's love and poesy.  Long had they loved each
other; but the father of Annie, the old Whig
Baronet of Maxwelton, had engendered a furious
hostility to Douglas, in consequence of his
soldiers having lived at free quarters on his estates
in Dumfriesshire, where they made very free,
indeed, burned down a few farms, shot and houghed
the cattle, and extorted a month's marching
money thrice over, with cocked matches and
drawn rapiers.
</p>

<p>
"This visit is as unexpected as it is welcome,"
continued Walter; "and, for the honour it does
me, I would not exchange&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Thy prison for a palace," interrupted Annie.
"Now, Mr. Walter, I know to an atom the value
of this compliment, which means exactly nothing.
But we must not jest; I have to introduce a dear
friend&mdash;one who has come to thank you personally
for those favours of which you are now paying
the price.  Come, Lilian, love," continued the
lively young lady, "approach and speak.  My
life on't! how the lassie trembles!  Come,
Finland, we understand this, and will keep guard
while little Lilian speaks with her captive paladin."
</p>

<p>
"You are a mad wag, Annie," said the cavalier,
as he gave her his ungloved hand; "but lower
your voice, dear one, or, soft and sweet as it is, it
may bring down the gudeman and all his rascals
about us in a trice."
</p>

<p>
"How can I find words to thank you, Mr. Fenton?"
said the tremulous voice of Lilian
Napier, whose small but beautiful face appeared
without the massive grating, peeping through a plaid
of dark green tartan, a mode of disguise then very
common in Scotland, and which continued to be
so in the earlier part of the last century.  Like a
hooded mantilla, it floated over her graceful
shoulders, and a silver brooch confined it beneath
her dimpled chin.
</p>

<p>
"Lilian Napier here!" exclaimed Fenton with
rapture; "ah, fool that I was to repine, while my
miseries were remembered by thee!"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, sir, the Lady Bruntisfield has lamented
them bitterly.  Never can we repay you for the
unmerited severity and humiliations to which you
have been subjected in our cause.  Oh, can I
forget that but for you, Mr. Fenton, we might have
become the occupants of that frightful place, the
air of which chills me even here!"
</p>

<p>
"Thee&mdash;O no, Lilian Napier, they could not
have the heart to immure thee here!"
</p>

<p>
"The lack of heart rather, Walter."
</p>

<p>
"The idea is too horrible&mdash;but now," he
continued, in a voice of delight, "you are speaking
like my old companion and playfellow.  'Tis long&mdash;O,
very, very long, Lilian, since last we conversed
together alone.  Do you remember when we
gathered flowers, and rushes, and pebbles by the
banks of the Loch, and berries at the Heronshaw,
and gambolled in the parks in the summer sunshine?"
</p>

<p>
"How could I forget them?"
</p>

<p>
"Never have I been so happy since.  O, those
were days of innocence and joy!"
</p>

<p>
There was a pause, and both sighed deeply.
</p>

<p>
"Poor Walter, how sincerely I pity thee!"
</p>

<p>
"Then I bless the chance that brought me
here."
</p>

<p>
"In that cold dark pit&mdash;Oh, 'tis a place of
horror.  Would to Heaven I could free you,
Mr. Walter!"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Lilian, call me Walter, without the <i>Mr</i>.
Your voice sounds then as it did in other days,
ere cold conventionalities raised such a gulf
between us."
</p>

<p>
"They can do so no longer," said the young
lady, weeping; "we are landless and ruined now,
and O! did not fear for my good aunt Grisel make
me selfish, I would surrender myself to the
council to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"S'death! do not think of it!"
</p>

<p>
"We both accuse ourselves of selfishness&mdash;of
the very excess of cowardice, and of blotting our
honour for ever, by meanly flying and transferring
all our dangers to you."
</p>

<p>
"Do not permit yourself to think so," said
Walter, moved to great tenderness by her tears.
"Dear Lilian, (allow me so to call you, in memory
of our happier days,) leave me now&mdash;to tarry here
is full of danger.  If you are discovered by the
rascals who guard this place, the thought of what
would ensue may drive me mad; threats,
imprisonment, discovery, and disgrace&mdash;oh, leave
me, for God's sake, Lilian!"
</p>

<p>
"Besides, I may be compromising the safety of
those good friends who so kindly have accompanied
me hither to-night.  Ah! there is a terrible
proclamation against us fixed to the city cross;
they style us those intercommuned traitors, the
Napiers, umquhile of Bruntisfield."
</p>

<p>
"Then leave me, Lilian&mdash;I can be happy now,
knowing that you came&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"From Lady Grisel," said Lilian, hastily, "to
express her sincere thanks for your kindness, and
her deep sorrow for its sad requital, which (from
what you told us,) we could not have contemplated.
Indeed, Mr. Walter, we have been very
unhappy on your account, and so, impelled by a
sense of gratitude, I came to&mdash;to&mdash;" and, pausing,
she covered her face with her hands and wept,
for the new and humiliating situation in which
she found herself had deeply agitated her.  She
did not perceive a dark figure that approached her
softly, unseen by her friends, who were gaily
chatting under the gloomy shadow of a projecting
house, and quite absorbed in themselves.
</p>

<p>
"Lilian, you were ever good and gentle," said
Walter, altogether overcome by her tears, and
pressing her hand between his own.  "Deeply,
deeply do I feel the mortification you must
endure; but do not weep thus&mdash;it wrings my very
heart!"
</p>

<p>
She permitted him to retain her hand, (there
was no harm in that,) but his thoughts became
tumultuous; he kissed it; and as his lips touched
her for the first time, his whole soul seemed to
rush to them.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Lilian, were I rich, I feel that I could
love you."
</p>

<p>
"And if one is poor, can they not love too?"
she asked artlessly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, Lilian&mdash;dear Lilian," said Walter,
quite borne away by his passion, and greatly
agitated; but his arm could not encircle her, for the
envious grating intervened: "deeply do I feel at
this moment how bitter, how hopeless, may be
the love of the poor.  But if I dared to tell you
that the little page, Walter, who so often carried
your mantle and led your horse's bridle&mdash;now,
when a man, aspired so far&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The girl trembled violently, and said, in a feeble
voice of alarm, "Oh, hush&mdash;hush, some one
approaches."
</p>

<p>
"Then away to Douglas, for he alone can protect
you.  One word ere you go: you have found
a secure and secret shelter?"
</p>

<p>
"Humble and secret, at least."
</p>

<p>
"With the Lauries of Maxwelton?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, their house is already suspected.  In
the poor cottage of my nurse, old Elsie Elshender,
at St. Rocque&mdash;there we bide our fate in poverty
and obscurity."
</p>

<p>
"And your cousin, Napier, the captain?"
</p>

<p>
"Hath fled to the west&mdash;but that person&mdash;he
is certainly listening&mdash;adieu!"
</p>

<p>
"Remember me?"
</p>

<p>
"How can I forget?" she replied, naïvely, as
she arose to withdraw; but lo! the person started
forward, and her hand, which was yet glowing
with Walter's kiss, was rudely seized in the
rough grasp of the intruder.  Fear utterly
deprived the poor girl of power to cry out.
</p>

<p>
"Aunt Grisel&mdash;dear grand-aunt Grisel!" was
all she could gasp, and she would have sunk on
the pavement had not the eavesdropper supported
her.  He was a tall, stout gallant, and muffled, by
having the skirt of his cloak drawn over his right
shoulder, so as to conceal part of his face, then
the fashionable mode of disguise for roués and
intriguantes.
</p>

<p>
"Lilian Napier, by all the devils!" cried Lord
Clermistonlee, in a tone of astonishment: he was
considerably intoxicated, having just left the
neighbouring house, where he had been drinking
for the last six hours with the Lord President
Lockhart.  "Now I thought thee only some
poor mud-lark, or errant bona-roba.  This is truly
glorious.  Thou shalt come with me, my beauty.
What, you will scream?  Nay, minx, then you
have but a choice between the stone vaults of the
Tolbooth and the tapestried chambers of my poor
old houses of Drumsheugh and Clermistonlee&mdash;ha,
ha!" and he began to sing the old ditty:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "There was a young lassie lo'ed by an auld man&mdash;&mdash;"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Help, Finland, help, for the love of God!"
cried Lilian, dreadfully agitated, but the Lord
continued:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "With a heylillelu and a how-lo-lan!<br />
  Her cheeks were rose red, and her eyne were sky-blue,<br />
  With a how-lo-lan and a heylillelu!<br />
  And this lassie was lo'ed by this canty old man,<br />
  With a heylillelu and a how-lo-lan!"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"By all the devils!  I can sing as well as my Lord
the President, though he hath three crown bowls
of punch under his doublet."
</p>

<p>
"Douglas, Douglas, your sword&mdash;your sword!"
cried Walter, grasping the massive grating, and
swinging on the bars like a madman, essaying in
vain to wrench them from their solid wrests; but
ere the words had left his lips, Lord Clermistonlee
was staggered by a blow from the clenched hand
of the cavalier, and Lilian was free.
</p>

<p>
"Fly, Annie," he exclaimed to his love; "away
with Lilian Napier to the coach at the close head.
The devil, girl&mdash;art thou doited,&mdash;off and leave
me to deal with this tavern brawler.  Fore George!
I will truss his points in first rate fashion."  The
girls retired in terror, and Douglas unsheathed
his rapier.
</p>

<p>
"Beware thee, villain," exclaimed the other,
drawing his long bilbo with prompt bravery, and
wrapping his mantle round the left arm.  "I am
a Lord of the Privy Council&mdash;to draw on me is
treason."
</p>

<p>
"Were you King James himself, I would run
you through the heart, for applying such an epithet
to a gentleman of the House of Douglas."
</p>

<p>
"You will have it then&mdash;come on, plated varlet,
and look well to guard and parry, for I am a
first-rate swordsman."
</p>

<p>
Finland's cuirass rang with a rapier thrust from
his assailant, who fell furiously to work, lunging
like a madman, and exclaiming every time the fire
sparked from their clanging blades,
</p>

<p>
"Bravo, bilbo!  Excellent&mdash;come on again,
Mr. Malapert, and I will teach thee to measure
swords with Randal of Clermistonlee.  Gads-o,
fellow, thou art no novice in the science of
fencing&mdash;crush me, what a thrust! well parried&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "With a hey lillelu, and a how&mdash;&mdash;'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Damnation seize thee, man! how came that
about!"
</p>

<p>
The sword of Finland, by one lucky parry had
broken the Lord's rapier off by the hilt, and
ripped up the skin of his sword-hand with such
force that he staggered against the wall.
</p>

<p>
"I hope your Lordship is not hurt!" exclaimed
his antagonist, supporting him by the arm.
</p>

<p>
"Zounds, no! a little only," replied Clermistonlee,
whom the shock had perfectly sobered.  Full
of rage, he tossed his embossed sword-hilt over
the house-tops, exclaiming, "Accursed blade, may
the hands that forged thee grill on the fires of
eternity!"
</p>

<p>
It whistled through the air, and fell down the
chimney of the dowager Lady Drumsturdy, where
it stuck midway, and so terrified that ancient dame
that, notwithstanding her hatred to "massemongers,"
she laid her poker and shovel <i>crosswise</i>;
but the mysterious noise in her capacious "lum"
formed a serious case for the investigation of
ghost-seers and gossips next day.
</p>

<p>
"Harkee, Laird of Finland," said Clermistonlee
haughtily, "we must enact this affair over
again in daylight; meantime let us part, or the
Town-Guard will be upon us with their partisans,
and I have no wish that you should suffer for
ripping up an inch or two of skin in fair
fight&mdash;you will hear from me anon."
</p>

<p>
"Whenever your Lordship pleases, I am your
most obedient," replied Douglas, bowing coldly as
he hurried to join the terrified ladies, with whom
he had barely time to get into the hackney-coach
and drive off, when the door of the prison opened,
and a few of the Town Guard, who had heard the
clashing of the rapiers, rushed forth with lanterns
and poleaxes; like modern police, exhibiting great
alacrity when the danger was over, they seized
Clermistonlee.
</p>

<p>
"Dare ye lay hands on a gentleman," he exclaimed,
fiercely shaking them off.  "Unhand me,
villains, I am Randal Lord Clermistonlee!  I was
assaulted&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"By whom, my Lord, by whom?" replied the
guardians of the peace, cringing before this
imperious noble.
</p>

<p>
"What is it to such rascals as thee?&mdash;oh, a knavish
cloak snatcher, or cut-purse, or something of
that kind.  Retire&mdash;I have always hands to defend
myself."
</p>

<p>
The guard with hurried and half audible
apologies withdrew, and the brawling lord was left
to his own confused reflections.  He tied a
handkerchief about his hand, and was about to
withdraw, when a thought struck him: he approached
the grating of the low dungeon, and placing close
to it his face, which though unseen was pale
with fury, while his dark eyes gleamed like two
red sparks,
</p>

<p>
"Art there, thou spawn of the Covenant?" he
asked in a husky voice: "Ah, dog of a Fenton,
I will hang thee high as Haman for this night's
misadventure!"
</p>

<p>
The prisoner replied by a scornful laugh, and
the exasperated roué strode away.
</p>

CHAPTER XI.
<br /><br />
CLERMISTONLEE AT HOME.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  "Too long by love a wandering fire misled,<br />
  My latter days in vain delusion fled;<br />
  Day after day, year after year, withdrew,<br />
  And beauty blessed the minutes as they flew,<br />
  These hours consumed in joy, but lost to fame&mdash;&mdash;"<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HAMILTON OF BANGOUR.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The town residence of Lord Clermistonlee was
a lofty and narrow mansion of antique aspect; it
stood immediately within the Craig-end-gate, that
low-browed archway in the eastern flank of the
city wall, which, from the foot of Leith Wynd
still faces the bluff rock of the Calton.  With
high pedimented windows and Flemish gables,
Clermiston-lodging towered above the mossy,
grass-tufted, and time-worn rampart of the city&mdash;the
aforesaid portal of which gave entrance to it
on one side, while the more immediate path from
the great central street was a steep and narrow
close, the mansions of which were as black as the
smoke of four centuries could make them.  Their
huge façades, plastered over with rough lime and
oyster shells, completely intercepted the view to
the south, while that to the north was shut in by
the black cliffs of the bare Calton and the
Multrees-hill with the ancient suburb of St. Ninian,
straggling through the narrow chasm that yawned
between them, and afforded a glimpse of Leith
and the far-off hills of Fife.  At the base of the
hill lay the last fragments of the monastery of
Greenside, and opposite a thatched hamlet crept
close to the margin of the Loch, the broad sluice
of which the irrascible Baillies of Edinburgh
invariably shut, when they quarrelled with a colony of
sturdy and "contumacious" weavers and tanners
who had located there, and whose communication
with Halkerstoune Wynd they could cut off at
pleasure by damming up the waters of the Loch.
Immediately under the windows of the mansion
lay the park, hospital, and venerable church of
the Holy Trinity, founded by the Queen of James
II. about two hundred years before.
</p>

<p>
On the night described in the last chapter, a
large fire burned cheerily in the chamber of dais;
and the walls of wainscot, varnished and gilded,
glittered in its glow.  Supper was laid; carved
crystal, plate, and snow-white napery gleamed in
the light of the ruddy fire, and of four large wax
candles that towered aloft in massive square
holders of French workmanship.  Over the
mantel-piece, in an oak frame amid the carving of
which, grapes, nymphs, and bacchanals were all
entwined together, hung a portrait painted by
Jamieson, representing a pale young lady in a ruff
and fardingale of James VI. days, and having the
pale blue eyes, exquisitely fair complexion and
lint-white locks, which were then so much
admired.  It was his Lordship's mother, a lady
of the house of Spynie.
</p>

<p>
Silver plate, a goodly row of labelled flasks
(bottling wine was not then the custom) and
various substantial viands formed a corps-de-reserve
on a grotesquely carved buffet of black
oak, for everything was fashioned after the
grotesque in those days.  The knobs of the red
leather chairs, and the ponderous fire-irons, were
strange and open-mouthed visages; the brackets
supporting the cornices of the doors and the
mantel-piece, were also strange bacchanalian faces
grinning from wreaths of vine-leaves, clusters of
grapes and crowns of acanthus.  Three long
silver-hilted rapiers with immense pommels,
shells, and guards, pistols, steel caps, masks, foils,
and a buff coat richly laced with silver, lay all
huddled in a corner, while the broad mantel-piece
presented quite an epitome of the proprietor's
character.
</p>

<p>
The massive stone lintel displayed in bold
relief the legend carved thereon by his pious
forefathers,
</p>

<p class="t3">
Blyssit be God for al his giftis, 1540.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
but above it lay Andro Hart's "Compendious
Book of Godly Songs," beside the "Gaye Lady's
Manuall," and the "Banqvet of Jests or change
or cheare imprinted at the shoppe in Ivie Lane
1634," a book of ribbald ditties, another of
farriery, another of falconry, obscene plays;
Rosehaugh's "Disertations" sent by the author, and
used by Clermistonlee to light his Dutch pipe;
whistles, whips, hunting horns, and drinking
flasks, cards, dice, hawks' hoods, an odd pistol,
papers of council, warrants of search, arrest, and
torture, mingled with challenges and frivolous
billets-doux.  A large wolfish dog, and a very
frisky red-eyed Scottish terrier slept together on
the warm hearth-rug.
</p>

<p>
Juden Stenton, the stout old butler, had stirred
the fire and wiped the glasses for the tenth time,
tasted the wine for the twentieth, and had made
as many rounds of the table to snuff the candles,
and re-examine everything; he was very impatient
and sleepy, and listened intently with his
head bent low, a practice which he had acquired in
the great civil wars.  The clock in the spire of
the Netherbow-porte struck midnight.
</p>

<p>
"Cocksnails!" muttered Juden, "twelve o'clock
and nae sign o' him yet.  What's the world
coming to?  My certie, what would his farther the
douce Laird o' Drumsheugh hae thocht o' this
kind of work?  He (honest man!) was aye in his
nest at the first tuck o' the ten o'clock drum."
</p>

<p>
Juden was verging on sixty years of age; his
figure was short and paunchy, his face full and
florid; his twinkling grey eyes wore always a
cunning expression, and had generally a sotted
appearance about them, which made it extremely
difficult to determine whether he was drunk or
sober.  His large round head was bald, and his
chin close shaven, according to the fashion for the
lower classes, few but nobles and cavaliers
retaining the manly moustaches and imperial.  A clean
white cravat fell over his doublet of dark-green
cloth, the red braiding of which was neatly curved
to suit his ample paunch; breeches of dark plush,
black cotton stockings and heavy shoes, the
instep of each being covered by a large brass
buckle, completed his attire.  A scar still
remained on his shining scalp to attest the dangers
he had dared in his younger days.
</p>

<p>
The last of a once numerous and splendid but
now diminished household, old Juden Stenton
was a faithful follower of Lord Clermistonlee, for
whom he would have laid down his life without a
sigh of regret.  He acted by turns butler and baillie,
cook and valet, groom, farrier, trooper, and
factotum, being the beau ideal of the staunch but
unscrupulous serving-man of the day, who changed
sides in religion, politics, and everything just as
the Laird did, and who knew no will or law save
those of his leader and master.  When
Clermistonlee (then Sir Randal Clermont of
Drumsheugh), ruined by the mad excesses into which
he had plunged at the dissipated court of Charles
II., in a fit of despair joined the insurgent
Covenanters at Bothwell Bridge, Juden put a blue
cockade in his bonnet, "girded up his loins," as
he said, "and went forth to battle for Scotland's
oppressed kirk and broken covenant."  But when
Sir Randal's name (in consequence of mistake, or of
some friendly influence in the Scottish cabinet) was
omitted in the list of the attainted, and he changed
sides, obtaining&mdash;none knew how or why&mdash;rank
and riches under the persecutors, Juden changed
too, and donning the buff coat and scarlet, became
a bitter foe to "all crop-eared and psalmsinging
rebels," and riding as a royalist trooper,
suppressed many a harmless conventicle, and hunted
and hounded, slashed and shot, or dragged to
prison those who had been his former comrades,
for in political matters Juden's mind was as facile
and easy as that of a German.
</p>

<p>
He had too often less honourably acted the
pander to his lord, in many a vile intrigue and
cruel seduction; for of all the wild rakes of the
time (Rochester excepted) none had rushed so
furiously on the career of fashionable vice and
dissipation as Clermistonlee; and even now, when
forty years of age, he continued the same kind of
life from mere habit, perhaps, rather than
inclination.
</p>

<p>
But there was one chapter of his life which
memory brought like a cloud on his gayest hours,
and which riot and revel could never efface,&mdash;a
sad episode of domestic mystery and unhappiness.
Clermistonlee, in the prime of his youth, had been
wedded to a lady of beauty and rank, of extreme
gentleness of manner and softness of disposition.
Like many others, <i>the fancy</i> passed away; repentance
came, as his love cooled or changed to other
objects.  He took the lady to Paris, and there she
died......  There were not wanting evil tongues,
who said he had destroyed her.  A kind of mystery
enveloped her fate; and even in his most joyous
moods, sad thoughts would suddenly cloud the
lofty brow of Clermistonlee, a sign which his kind
friends never failed to attribute to remorse.  Many
were the women who had trusted to his honour,
and found they had believed in a phantom; until,
at the era of our story, his name had become (like
that of the Marquis de Laval) a bye-word in the
mouths of the people for all that was wicked,
irregular, and bad.
</p>

<p>
"Twelve o'clock," muttered Juden; "braw
times&mdash;braw times, sirs!  I warrant he'll be
roistering in the change-house o' that runagate
vintner, Hugh Blair, at the Pillars.  A wanion on
his sour Gascon and fushionless Hock!  Waiting
is sleepy work, and dry too.  Gude claret this!
My service to ye, Maister Juden Stenton," he
continued, bowing to his reflection in an opposite
mirror; "you're a gude and worthy servitor to
ane that doesna ken your value.  The members o'
council maun a' be fu' as pipers by this time
except Claverhouse, wha canna touch wine, and auld
Binns, wham wine canna touch.  Hech! here he
comes; and now for a clamjamfray wi' the yett-wards."
</p>

<p>
A violent knocking at the city-gate close by
announced the return of his master from a
midnight ramble.  The sentinel within opened the
wicket of the barrier; and on demanding the usual
toll required of belated citizens, a handful of pence,
flung by the impatient lord, clattered about his
steel cap.  Clermistonlee entered, and, half dragging
a little crooked man after him, rapidly ascended
the flight of steps that led to the circular tower or
staircase of his own house.  In the low-pointed
doorway, which was surmounted by an uncouth
coronet, stood Juden with a candle flaring in each
hand, bowing very low, though not in the best of
humours.
</p>

<p>
"Od, that weary body Mersington is w' him!"
he muttered.  "The auld spunge&mdash;he'll drink the
daylicht in!"
</p>

<p>
"Light the way there, Juden," cried his master.
"My good Lord Mersington is generally short-sighted
about this hour."
</p>

<p>
"Double-sighted, ye mean," chuckled the
decrepit senator.  "Sorrow tak' ye, Randal, ye
maun aye hae your joke&mdash;he! he!  A cauld nicht
this, Juden," he added, while hobbling up the
narrow stair, with an enormous wig and
broad-brimmed beaver overshadowing his meagre
figure.
</p>

<p>
"A cauld morning rather, please your lordship,"
replied Juden somewhat testily, as he ushered
them into the chamber-of-dais, and stirred the fire
as well as the chain which secured the poker to
the jamb permitted him.
</p>

<p>
"Be seated, Mersington.  This way, my Lord;
take care of the table&mdash;devil! the man's blind,"
said Clermistonlee, as he somewhat unceremoniously
pushed the half-intoxicated senator
into one of the high-backed chairs of red
maroquin.
</p>

<p>
Mersington was twenty years his senior, and
never was there a pair of more ill-assorted gossips
or friends.  The one, a polished and fashionable
cavalier roué; the other, a cranky and meagre
compound of vulgarity, shrewdness, and ignorance,
who was never sober, but had obtained a
seat on the bench in consequence of his inflexible
devotion to the Government, to please whom he
would have sent the twelve apostles to "testify"
at the Bow-foot, had it been required of him.
Clermistonlee unbuckled his belt, and flung his
empty scabbard to the one end of the room, his
plumed beaver to the other, and drew his chair
hastily forward to the table.
</p>

<p>
"Where is your braw bilbo, my Lord?" asked
Juden.
</p>

<p>
"What the devil is it to thee?&mdash;'Tis broken.  I
will wear the steel-hilted backsword to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"The auld blade ye wore at the Brigg?"
</p>

<p>
"D&mdash;n Bothwell Brigg!  How is Meg?"
</p>

<p>
"Muckle the same, puir beastie."
</p>

<p>
"I hope, knave, thou gavest her the warm mash,
and bathed her nostrils and fetlocks."
</p>

<p>
"Without fail.  We maun tak' gude care o'
her&mdash;the last o' a braw stud of sixty, my faith!
But when a mear hath baith the wheezlock and
the yeuk&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"How! has she both?"
</p>

<p>
"Had ye, a month syne, tar-barrelled that auld
carlin, Elshender, owre the muir at St. Rocque,
Meg would hae been sound, wind and limb, frae
that moment."
</p>

<p>
"'Sblood!  Juden, dost think the cantrips of
this old hag have really bedevilled my favourite
nag?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm no just free to say, my Lord; but it is
unco queer that Meg (puir beastie!) should fa' ill
o' sae mony things just after Lucky Elshender
flyted wi' ye for riding through her kail for a near
cut to the Grange, the day ye dined wi' auld
Fountainhall."
</p>

<p>
"By all the devils, Juden, if I thought this
bearded hag had any hand in the mare's illness,
I would have her under the hands of the pricker
to-morrow," replied Clermistonlee, who was deeply
imbued with the Scottish prejudice against old
women.  "We had before us to-day two hags,
whom we consigned to the flames; one for
confessing witchcraft, and the other for obstinately
refusing to confess it."
</p>

<p>
Juden rubbed his hands.
</p>

<p>
"Ou aye&mdash;ou aye&mdash;he! he!" chuckled Mersington.
"Hae her up before the fifteen&mdash;a full
blawn case o' sorcery&mdash;on wi' the thumbikins!
I have kent rack and screw bring mony a queer
story to light:&mdash;riding to Banff on a besom-shank&mdash;sailing
to the Inch in a milkbowie&mdash;bewitching
wheels that ane minute flew round as if the mill
was mad, and the next stood like the Bass
rock&mdash;raising a storm o' wind in the lift by the damnable
agency of a black beetle, 'ane golach,' as
Rosehaugh called it in the indictment.  We had a
grand case o' that lately in the northern courts."
</p>

<p>
"But the gude auld fashion o' tar-barrelling is
clean gaing out in thae fushionless days," said
Juden, whom Mersington treated with considerable
familiarity.  "We havena had a respectable
bleeze on the Castle-hill these aucht years and
mair."
</p>

<p>
"You may chance to have one very shortly,"
replied his lord impatiently, "if Meg gets not the
better of her ailings soon.  But enough of
this.&mdash;Let us to supper."
</p>

<p>
"Bluid, as I live!  Foul fa' the loon that shed
it!" exclaimed Juden, in accents of intense
concern, as his master drew off his perfumed gloves,
and revealed the scar on his right hand.  "Whatna
collyshangie has this been, noo&mdash;and your braw
mantle o' drab de Berrie&mdash;oh laddie, when will
you learn to tak' care o' yoursel?" added honest
Juden, who from force of habit still styled his
lord as he had done thirty years ago.
</p>

<p>
"Pshaw! you have seen my blood ere now, I
suppose."
</p>

<p>
"Owre often, owre often," groaned the old
man.  "You'll hae been keeping the croon o' the
causeway, I warrant, majoring rapier in hand, as
your faither was wont in his young days."
</p>

<p>
"No, no; I merely measured swords in Gourlay's
close with one of the Scots' musqueteers."
</p>

<p>
"Aboot what?  They're mad, unchancey chields,
Dunbarton's men."
</p>

<p>
"A girl&mdash;the cursed baggage!"
</p>

<p>
"Burn my beard, if ever I saw dochter o' Eve
that tempted me to encounter a slashed hide!"
said Juden, with a tone of thankfulness, while his
master tied a handkerchief round the wounded
limb, and applied himself to the viands before
him, attending to his friend with hospitality and
politeness, and doing the honours of the table
with peculiar grace.
</p>

<p>
A roasted capon, mutton and cutlets, oysters
fried and raw, a gigantic silver mug of brandy and
burnt sugar, a tankard of sack, and several tall
silver-mouthed decanters of claret, with manchets
of the whitest flour, oaten cakes, and fruit,
composed the supper, on sitting down to which, Lord
Mersington, with an affected air and half-closed
eyes, by way of grace mumbled a distich then
common among the cavaliers&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "From Covenanters with uplifted hands,<br />
  From Remonstrators with associate bands,<br />
  From such Committees as governed these nations,<br />
  From Kirk Commissions and their protestations,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good Lord, deliver us!'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Amen," said Clermistonlee, "d&mdash;n all Kirk
Commissioners and Sessions too!"
</p>

<p>
"The last keepit a firm hand owre such
gallants as you, before King Charles cam' hame,"
replied Mersington, who, like all meagre men,
was a great gourmand, and was doing ample
justice to all the good things before him.
Clermistonlee, too, notwithstanding the lateness of
the hour, did his part fairly&mdash;but all times were
alike to him, his irregular habits and debauched
life had by long custom made them so, and
he assailed the capon, the cutlets, the oysters,
and sack tankard, in rapid succession, while
Juden stood behind his chair, napkin in hand,
with eyes half-closed, and nodding head.
</p>

<p>
"Mersington, some more of the cutlets?  My
Lord, you must permit me&mdash;do justice to my poor
house, a bachelor's though it be.  Juden, hand
that dish of Crail capons from the buffet."
</p>

<p>
The butler hastily placed before his master an
ample dish containing a pile of small haddocks
prepared in a mode now disused and forgotten.
</p>

<p>
"Crail capons&mdash;allow me to help you; and
don't spare the burnt sack, my Lord."
</p>

<p>
"Thank ye:&mdash;weel, then, Clermistonlee, anent
this business of the Napiers," said Mersington,
referring to a former conversation; "what mean
ye to do now, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Use every means to obtain their lands&mdash;and
Lilian to boot," replied his friend, after a brief
pause, and while a slight colour crossed his cheek.
"I have taken a particular fancy for that old
house of Bruntisfield&mdash;ha, ha! with the parks
adjoining.  Faith, the lands run from the
Harestarie to my own gate at Drumsbeugh, and from
the Links, where young Bruntisfield was slain long
ago, to the house of the Chieslies, beside the devil
only knows how many tofts and tenements within
the walls of the city."
</p>

<p>
"A noble barony for a dowry!"
</p>

<p>
"It will form a seasonable subsidy to my
exchequer, which is drained to its last plack at
present.  You know I have long loved this girl."
</p>

<p>
"Or <i>said</i> so; but the lands, he, he! are forfeited
to the King, man!"
</p>

<p>
"So were those of the Mures of Caldwell, yet
Sir Thomas of Binns now holds them as a free
gift from the Council&mdash;and holds fast, too."
</p>

<p>
"Auld Dame Bruntisfield is but a life-rentrix;
thou knowest, man, that Captain Napier, of
Buchan's regiment of Scots'-Dutch, is the next
and last heir of entail."
</p>

<p>
"Tush!  I will have <i>him</i> under the nippers of
the Lord Advocate ere long; when his head is on
yonder battlements of the Nether Bow, the barony
of Bruntisfield goes to Lilian Napier, and dost
think, Mersington, that chitti-faced girl will stand
in my way?  I trow not.  Maclutchy and some
of our best-trained beagles are on the captain's
track, and they will run him down somewhere in
the west country, depend upon it.  But 'tis
neither hall nor holm, wood or water, that will
satisfy me&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Odsfish, man! he, he! what mair would ye
hae, Randal?  There is the auld dame denounced
a rebel, and in default of compearance, put to the
horn; her moveable gudes and gear escheat to
the King, conform to the acts thereanent, and sae
are the heritable, but the Council will soon snap
them up.  What mair would ye hae?"
</p>

<p>
"The person of little Lilian," said Clermistonlee,
with a sinister smile, as he winked over the
top of his great silver tankard.
</p>

<p>
"Hee, hee!" chuckled Mersington.
</p>

<p>
"I would give a thousand broad pieces&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"If ye had them!"
</p>

<p>
"Crush me! yes.&mdash;&mdash;to discover where the
young damsel is in hiding at this moment.
Accustomed to subdue women from very habit, her
piquant coldness and hauteur have inflamed,
surprised, and offended me, and by all the devils, I
will have her, though I should be tumbled down
the precipice of hell for it!" he continued, in the
cavalier phraseology.  "And this fellow, Fenton,
this silken slave, who crossed me on the very
night I had hoped to have her arrested (he ground
his teeth), and that braggart, Douglas of Finland,
who was so ready with his rapier to-night, let them
look to it; my path shall not be crossed with
impunity by man or devil."
</p>

<p>
"Nor is that of any Lord of Council, while a
warrant of arrest and ward may be had from Mackenzie
for the asking, like the <i>lettre-de-cachet</i> o'
our French friends."
</p>

<p>
"True, my Lord&mdash;our laws are severe; they
are written in blood, like those of Draco, the
Athenian.  If this fellow, Finland, has the young
lady concealed about Edinburgh, and if I thought
he had a deeper aim in view, than merely crossing
me, I vow to Heaven, I would make him a terrible
example to all such rascally intermeddlers
with the purposes of their betters."
</p>

<p>
His half-intoxicated companion looked slyly at
him over his inverted tankard, and replied,
</p>

<p>
"Get a warrant of search, and send every
macer, messenger-at-arms, and toun guardsman
after your dearie&mdash;he, he! and proclaim at the cross
by tuck of drum, that the Right Honourable the
Lord Clermistonlee, Baron of Drumsheugh and
Knight of the Thistle, will pay one thousand
marks of our gude Scottish money to the
discoverer, or producer&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Hush, Mersington, you jest too much on this
matter.  Withered be my tongue for speaking of
this project to thee&mdash;but the deed is done, and I
might as well have proclaimed it by sound of
trumpet at the Tron."
</p>

<p>
"You have been a wild buckie in your day,
Randal," said Lord Mersington; "and when I
think o' all the braw queans, gentle as weel as
simple, that you have loved and abandoned,
gude-lackaday!  I marvel that the whinger of some
fierce brother or father hath not cut short your
career o' gallantry.  How about your fair one in
Merlin's Wynd?"
</p>

<p>
"Pshaw!  I tired of her long ago."
</p>

<p>
"And Lady Mary Charteris?"
</p>

<p>
"By all the devils, 'tis very droll to hear you
speak of a noble lady and a poor bona-roba in the
same breath.  Mary is beautiful, magnificently so,
but wary, proud, and poor&mdash;we would hate each
other in a week.  Now I really think little Lilian
Napier is capable of fixing all my wandering
fancies into one focus for life."
</p>

<p>
"He, he," chuckled Mersington, "I have
heard you say the same o' twenty.  But a peer of
the realm, heir of&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"The whole heraldic honours of the house of
Clermont, which you see on yonder window-pane,
or, three bars wavy embattled, surmounted by
a lion <i>sable&mdash;argent</i>, a bend engrailed <i>gules</i>, and
so forth.  Ha, ha!"
</p>

<p>
"The coronet aboon them is a braw die, and
ane that glitters weel in lassies' een."
</p>

<p>
"With Lilian Napier it has no more value than
a peasant's bonnet.  A thousand times I have
endeavoured to gain her notice, by the most
respectful attentions, which the little gipsy ever
evaded, or affected to misunderstand, treating me
with the most frigid coldness.  The older lady,
perhaps, is not indisposed towards me, but the
memory of&mdash;Fury! always <i>that</i> thought!.....  I
never was crossed in my purpose, and now I mean
to hang Quentin Napier, and marry his cousin
forthwith.  Ha, ha!"
</p>

<p>
"What, if he should discover and carry her off
in the meantime?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah&mdash;the devil! don't think of that.  I would
give a hundred French crowns to have the right
scent after her."
</p>

<p>
"I could do sae for half the money, my lord,"
said Juden, suddenly waking up from his
standing doze.
</p>

<p>
"The deuce! fellow, art <i>thou</i> there?"
exclaimed his master with stern surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Fellow, indeed!" reiterated the ancient
servitor, indignantly.  "Troth, I was the best o'
gude fallows when I received on my ain croon
here, the cloure that Claverse meant for yours, in
that braw tulzie on Bothwell Brigg."
</p>

<p>
"True, Juden&mdash;though I like not being
overheard in some matters," replied the lord
more kindly; "but as Colonel Grahame and I
are now the best of friends, it would be better to
recall the memory of bygone days as little as
possible.  Dost hear me?"
</p>

<p>
"And Alison Gifford&mdash;my lady that is dead
and gone now, puir thing," continued Juden,
spitefully and mournfully, knowing well that her
name stung Clermistonlee to the soul.  "Often,
and often, she used to say, 'you are a gude and
leal servitor, Juden, and the laird (ye were but a
laird then), can never think enough, or mak'
enough o' ye, Juden&mdash;for ye are one that, come
weal, come woe, peace or war, victory or defeat,
will stick to the house o' Clermont, Juden, like a
burr on a new bannet.  But losh me! <i>he</i> doesna
ken the worth o' ye Juden!'"  The pawkie
butler raised his table napkin to hide "the tears
he did <i>not</i> shed;" but the face of Lord Clermistonlee,
which had gradually grown darker as he
continued to speak, now wore a terrible
expression.  "Puir young Lady Alison! sae kind and
sae gentle, sae sweet-tempered, blooming and
bonnie.  You were aye owre rough and haughty
wi' her, my lord&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ten thousand curses!&mdash;wretch and varlet! whence
all this insolence, and why this maudlin
grief?" cried Clermistonlee, in a voice of thunder.
"Why speak of Alison? she sleeps in peace in
the old aisles of St. Marcel, in Paris, and are her
ashes to be ever thrown upon me thus?  S'death! away,
sirrah.  Get thee gone, or the sack tankard
may follow <i>that</i>!"
</p>

<p>
And plucking off his long black wig, he flung
it full in Juden's face.
</p>

<p>
Without making any immediate reply, the latter
picked up the ample wig, carefully brushed the
flowing curls with his hand, and hung it upon the
knob of a chair.  He then turned to leave the
room, but pausing, said slyly&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Then, my Lord, ye dinna want to ken where
this bonnie bird could be netted.  I could cast
your hawk to the perch in a minute."
</p>

<p>
"Art sure of that, sirrah?"
</p>

<p>
"My thumb on't, Clermistonlee, I will."
</p>

<p>
"You are a pawkie auld carle, Juden," said his
master, in an altered voice; "but tell with brevity
what ye know of this matter."
</p>

<p>
"Lucky Elshender, a cottar body at St. Rocque,
owre the Burghmuir yonder, was nurse to the Lady
Lilian&mdash;yea, and to her mother before her.  Though
as wicked and cankered an auld carlin as ever tirled
a spindle, or steered hell-kail, she was ane leal and
faithful servitor to the house o' Bruntisfield, for
her gudeman and his twa sons died in their stirrups
by Sir Archibald's side, on that black day by
the Keithing Burn.  Sae, Clermistonlee, as she
is a body mickle trusted by the family, if any
woman or witch in a' braid Scotland can enlighten
ye anent this matter, it is Lucky Elshender.  And
maybe my Lord Mersington (he's asleep, the
gomeral body) will be sae gude as keep in memory,
that there is not an auld wife in the three Lothians
mair deserving o' a fat tar-barrel bleezing under
her, in respect o' puir Meg's mischanter."
</p>

<p>
"Right, Juden," replied his master.  "She
may be brought to the stake yet, though the taste
for such exhibitions is somewhat declining among
our gentles.  To-morrow I will have her dragged
to the Laigh Chamber; and if there is any truth
in her tongue, or blood in her fingers, I warrant
Pate Pincer's screws will produce both.  Take
these, Juden, as earnest of the largess I will give
if the scent holds good."
</p>

<p>
But Juden drew back from the proffered gold
pieces.
</p>

<p>
"If I am to serve ye, my Lord, as a leal vassal
and servitor ought, and as I served your honoured
faither before ye, and my forbears did yours in
better and braver times, ye will hold me excused
from touching a bodle o' this reward, or ony
other beyond my yearly fee and livery coat.
Keep your gowd, Clermistonlee, for faith ye need
it mair than auld Juden Stenton; and sae, as my
een are gathering straws, I will bid your
Lordship a gude morning, and hie cannily away to my
nest, for, by my sooth! there's the Norloch shining
through the window shutters like silver in the
braid day light."  And so saying, Juden
withdrew with a jaunty step, pleased with his own
magnanimous refusal.
</p>

<p>
Though a good-hearted man in the main, and
one, who (where his master's honour, interest,
fancy, or aggrandizement were not concerned)
would not have injured a fly, then how much less
a human being, Juden Stenton had thus without
the slightest scruple set fire to a train which
might end in the ruin and misery of an already
unfortunate family, and the dishonour and
destruction of an amiable and gentle girl, in whose
fortunes and misfortunes we hope to interest the
reader still more anon.

<h3>
CHAPTER XII.
<br /><br />
THE COTTAGE OF ELSIE.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  "Ha! honest nurse, where were my eyes before?<br />
  I know thy faithfulness and need no more."<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ALLAN RAMSAY.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Several days elapsed without our tyrannical
voluptuary being able to do anything personally
in the discovery, or persecution of the Napiers.
His wounded hand from neglect became
extremely painful, and his late debauch with
Mersington had thrown him into a state so feverish,
that luckily he was compelled to keep within his
own apartments; but obstacles only inflamed his
passion and exasperated his obstinacy.  It would
be difficult to analyze the sentiments he
entertained towards Lilian Napier.  Love, in the purer,
nobler, and more exalted idea of the passion he
assuredly had not.  His overweening pride had
been bitterly piqued by her hauteur.  The beauty
of her person, and the inexpressible charm of her
manner had first attracted him, and, notwithstanding
the studied coldness with which he was
treated, the passion of the roué got the better of
judgment.  Lilian's great expectations, too, had
farther inflamed his ardour; but all the attentions
which he proffered on every occasion with
inimitable address, were utterly unavailing, and for
the first time the gay Lord Clermistonlee found
himself completely baffled by a girl.  Surprised
at her opposition, his pride and constitutional
obstinacy became powerfully enlisted in the affair,
and he determined by forcible abduction, or some
such coup-de-main, to subdue the haughty little
beauty to his purpose.  Although he had been
unable to prosecute his amour in person, Juden
and others had narrowly watched the cottage of
old Elshender, and brought from thence such
reports as convinced his Lordship that she alone
could enlighten him as to the retreat of Lilian
and Lady Grizel, if they were not actually
concealed within her dwelling.
</p>

<p>
Though a munificent reward had been offered
for their discovery, trusting to the well-known
faith and long-tried worth of their aged vassal,
the ladies had found a shelter in her humble
residence, correctly deeming that a house so poor and
so near the city walls would escape unsearched,
when one at a distance might not.  There they
dwelt in the strictest seclusion and disguise on
the very marge of their ample estates, and almost
within view of the turrets of their ancient
manor-house.
</p>

<p>
Since the torture to which the unhappy Ichabod
Bummel had been subjected, and his subsequent
imprisonment on the Bass Rock (where Peden of
Glenluce, Scott of Pitlochie, Bennett of Chesters,
Gordon of Earlston, Campbell of Cesnock, and
others endured a strict captivity as the price of
sedition), Lady Grizel and Lilian hoped that their
involvement with the Orange spies, and their
flight, would soon be alike forgotten, especially
now, when they were so utterly ruined and
impoverished by proscription, that they were forced to
share the bounty of their humblest vassal.
</p>

<p>
Near the old ruined chapel of St. Rocque, and
close under the outspread branches of a clump of
lofty beech trees, by the side of the ancient loan
that led to Saint Giles' Grange, nestled the little
thatched cottage of Elsie Elshender.  It was
low-roofed, and its thick heavy thatch was covered
with grass and moss of emerald green.  The
white-washed walls were massive, and perforated
by four small windows, each about a foot square,
but crossed by an iron bar; two faced the loan in
front, and two overlooked the kailyard and byre
to the back.  The cottage had one great
clay-built chimney, at the back of which was a little
eyelet hole, affording from the stone ingle-seats a
view of the arid hills of Braid, and the solitary
path that wound over their acclivities to the peel
of Liberton, then the patrimony of the loyal
Winrams.  On one side of the door was a turf
seat, on the other a daddingstone, where (in the
ancient fashion) the barley was cleansed every
morning, for the use of the family.  This humble
residence contained only a <i>but</i> and a <i>ben</i>, or inner
and outer apartment, and both were furnished
with box-beds opening in front with doors.  The
first chamber, though floored with hard beaten
clay, was as clean as whitening and sprinkled sand
could make it; a large fire of wood and peats
blazed on the rude hearth; and in its ruddy light
the various rows of Flemish ware, beechwood
luggies, milk-bowies, horn-spoons, and polished
pewter arrayed above the wooden buffet or
dresser, were all glittering in that shiny splendour
which a smart housewife loves.  Within the wide
fireplace on a pivet hung a glowing Culross girdle,
on which a vast cake was baking.
</p>

<p>
It was night, but neither lamp nor candle were
required; the fire's warm blaze gave ample light,
and a more comfortable little cottage than old
Elsie's when viewed by that hospitable glow, was
not to be found in the three Lothians.  Three
oak chairs of ancient construction, a table similar,
a great meal girnel in one corner, flanked by a
peat bunker in the other, and an odd variety of
stoups, pitchers, and three-legged stools made up
the background.  On the table lay an old quarto
bible from which Lilian read aloud certain
passages every night, Andro Hart's "Psalmes in Scot's
meter," and the "Hynd let loose" of the "Godly
Mr. Sheils," who was then in the hands of the
Phillistines, and keeping the Reverend Ichabod
Bummel company in the towers of the Bass.
Two kirn-babies decorated with blue ribbons, a
quaint woodcut of our first parents' joining hands
under what resembled a great cabbage in the
Garden of Eden appeared over the mantel-piece,
together with a long rusty partisan with which
the umquhile John Elshender had laid about him
like a Trojan on the battle-field of Dunbar.
</p>

<p>
Close by the ingle sat his widow Elsie enjoying
its warmth, and listening to the birr of her wheel.
She was a hale old woman of seventy years, with
a nose and chin somewhat prominent; her grey
hair was neatly disposed under a snowwhite cap
of that Flemish fashion which is still common in
Scotland, and over which a simple black ribbon
marks widowhood.  Her upper attire consisted of
a coarse skirt of dark blue stuff, over which fell a
short linen gown, reaching a little below her
girdle, which bristled with keys, knitting wires,
pincushion, and scissors.  Similarly attired in a
short Scottish gown, which showed to the utmost
advantage the full outline of her buxom figure, her
niece Meinie, a rosy, hazel-eyed, and dark-haired
girl of twenty, stood by the meal girnel baking
(Anglicé <i>kneading</i>), and as the sleeves of her
dress came but a little below the shoulder, her fair
round arms and dimpled elbows did not belie the
pretty and merry face, which now and then peeped
round at the group near the fire.  Two of these
ought perhaps to have been described first.
</p>

<p>
Disguised as a peasant, Lady Grisel no longer wore
her white hair puffed out by Monsieur Pouncet's
skill, but smoothed under a plain starched bigonet,
coif, or mutch (which you will), and very ill at
ease the stately old dame appeared in her hostess's
coarse attire.  By way of pre-eminence she occupied
the great leathern chair, in which no mortal had
been seated since the decease of John Elshender,
who for forty consecutive years had hung his
bonnet on a knob thereof, while taking his
evening doze therein, after a day's ploughing or
harrowing on the rigs of Drumdryan.
</p>

<p>
Clad in one of the short gowns of Meinie, her
foster-sister, Lilian looked more graceful and
decidedly more piquant, than when at home
rustling in lace, frizzled and perfumed; her fair
hair was gathered up in a simple snood like
that of a peasant girl; but never had peasant nor
peeress more beautiful or more glossy tresses.
The poor girl was very pale; constant watching
and anxiety, a feeling of utter abandonment and
helplessness should their retreat be traced, had
quite robbed her of that soft bloom, the glow of
perfect health and happiness, her cheeks had
formerly worn.
</p>

<p>
The cottage contained a secret hiding place,
constructed by that "pawkie auld carle," John
Elshender, as an occasional retreat in time of
peril, and therein the noble fugitives remained
during the day, issuing forth only at night, when,
the windows closed by shutters within and without,
and a well-barred door, precluded all chance of a
sudden discovery.  These precautions were
imperatively necessary: had the fugitives been seen
by any one, the exceeding whiteness of their
hands, the softness of their voices, and, above all,
the decided superiority of their air, would have
rendered all disguise unavailing.  In silence and
sadness Lady Bruntisfield sat gazing on the
changing features of the glowing embers; but her mind
was absorbed within itself.  Lilian was sewing,
or endeavouring to do so; her downcast eyes were
suffused with tears, and from time to time she
stole a glance at Aunt Grisel.  Every sound
startled and caused her to prick her delicate
fingers, or snap the thread, until compelled to
throw aside the work; she then drew near her
grand-aunt, bowed her head on her shoulder, and
wept aloud.
</p>

<p>
"Lilian, love!" exclaimed Lady Grisel,
endeavouring to command her own feelings, though
the quivering of her proud nether lip showed the
depth of her emotion.  "For my sake, if not for
your own, do not thus, every night, give way to
unavailing sorrow and regret."
</p>

<p>
Lilian's thoughts were wandering to poor
Walter Fenton in his prison, and she still wept.
</p>

<p>
"Marry come up! it would ill suit this little one
to become the wife of a Scottish baron or
gentleman of name!" said the old lady, pettishly.
"Lilian Napier, those tears become not your
blood, whilk you inherit from a warrior, whom
the bravest of our kings said had nae-peer in
arms.  Bethink ye, Lilian!  Ere I was your age,
I had seen my two brothers, Cuthbert and Ninian,
cloven down under their own roof-tree by the
Northumbrian Mosstroopers, and brave lads they
were as ever levelled pike or petronel.  O! yet in
my ears I hear the clink of their harness as they
fell dead on the flagstones of our hall; and never
may ye hear such sounds, Lilian, for they are
hard to thole.  But I was a brave lassie then,
and could bend a hackbut owre a rampart, or send
a dag-shot through an English burgonet, without
wincing or winking once; for my memory gangs
back to the days of gentle King Jamie, ere the
Scotsman had learned to give his ungauntled
hand to the Southron."
</p>

<p>
"Fearfu' times, my leddy," said Elsie, "fearfu'
times! waly, waly, I mind o' them weel."
</p>

<p>
"They tell us we are one people now,"
continued the Scottish dame, with kindling eyes.
"Malediction on those who think so!  I am a
Hume of the Cowdenknowes, and cannot forget
that my brothers, my husband, and his three fair
boys poured their heart's blood forth upon
English steel."
</p>

<p>
"Ill would it become your ladyship to do so,"
said Elsie, urging her wheel with increased
velocity, and resolving not to be outdone in garrulity
by Lady Grisel.  "Weel mayest thou greet my
bonnie bairn Lilian, for these are fearfu' times for
helpless women bodies, when the strong hand
and sharp sword can hardly make the brave man
haud his ain; but they are as nothing to what I
have seen, when the doolfu' persecution was hot
in the land.  I mind the time when, trussed up
wi' a tow like a spitted chucky, I was harled away
behind that neer-do-well trooper, Holsterlie, and
dookit thrice in Bonnington-linn by Claverse'
orders, and just as the water rose aboon my
mutch, gif I hadna cried 'God save King Charles
and curse the Covenant,' I hadna been spinning
here to-night.  Weary on't, I've aye had a doolfu'
cramp since that hour."
</p>

<p>
"A piece of a coffin keepeth away the cramp,
Elsie, but 'tis an unco charm, and one that I like
not."
</p>

<p>
"Gude keep us! how many puir folk I have
seen in my time hanged, or shot, or writhing in
great bodily anguish in the iron buits, wi' lighted
gun-matches bleezing between their birselled
fingers, and expiring in agonies awfu' to see and
fearfu' to remember, and a' rather than abjure the
Holy Covenant and bless the King."
</p>

<p>
"And rightly were they served, false rebels!"
said Lady Bruntisfield, striking her cane on the
floor.
</p>

<p>
"But let the persecutors tak' heed," continued
Elsie, heedless of the dame's Cavalier prejudices,
"for their foot shall slide in due time (as the
blessed word sayeth), the day of their calamity is
at hand, and the sore things that are coming upon
them make haste."
</p>

<p>
"O hush, dear Elsie," said Lilian, "you know
not who may hear you."
</p>

<p>
"True, Madame Lilian," continued the old
woman, "and your words are a burning reproach
against those who make it treason to whisper the
word, unless to the sound o' drums and shawlms,
and organs.  These are fearfu' times."
</p>

<p>
"Toots, nurse, I have seen waur," said Lady
Bruntisfield impatiently.
</p>

<p>
"Aye, my Leddy, in the year fifty, when the
army o' that accursed Cromwell came up by
Lochend brawly in array o' battle, wi' the sun o' a
summer morning glinting on their pike-heads and
steel caps; marching they were, but neither to
tuck of drum nor twang of horn, but to a fushionless
English hymn, whilk they aye skirled on the
eve o' battle.  But our braw lads beat the auld
Scots' march, and my heart warmed at the brattle
o' their drums and the fanfare o' the trumpets.
O, their thousands were a gallant sight to see, a'
lodged in deep trenches by Leith Loan, and the
green Calton braes covered wi' men-at-arms, and
bristling wi' spears and brazen cannon!  On the
topmost rock waved the banner o' the godly
Argyle, and a' the craigs were swarming wi' his
wild Hielandmen in their chain jackets and waving
tartans.  An awfu' time it was for me and mony
mair!  My puir gudeman (whom God sain) rode
in the Lowden Horse, under Sir Archibald's
banner (Heaven rest him too).  That morning I
grat like a bairn when hooking the buff coat on
his buirdly breiest, and clasping the steel helmet
on his manly broo, (O, hinnie Lilian, ne'er may ye
hae to do that for the man ye loe!) ere he gaed
forth to battle for this puir cot, his little bairns,
and me.  But heigh! it was a brave sight, and a
bonnie, to see our Lowden lads sweeping the
English birds o' Belial before them like chaff on
the autumn wind, though my heart was faint, and
fluttered like a laverock in the hawk's grasp, and
I trembled and prayed for my puir man Jock.
My een were ever on Sir Archibald's red
plume&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Red and blue, gules and argent, were his
colours, Elsie," said Lady Grisel, whose tears fell
fast.  "O, nursie, my ain hand twined them in
his helmet."
</p>

<p>
"True, my leddy," continued the old woman,
whose strong feelings imparted a force to her
language, "my een were ever on that waving plume,
for well I kent where the Laird was, John
Elshender was sure to be if in life.  Aye, Lilian,
hinnie, Sir Archibald's voice was as a trumpet in
the hour of strife.  'Bruntisfield!  Bruntisfield! bridle
to bridle, lads!'  We heard him shout on
every sough o' wind, 'God and the King!' and
ever an' anon his uplifted sword flashed among
the English helmets like the levin brand on a
winter night, and mony a gay feather, and mony a
gay fellow fell before it."
</p>

<p>
"Peace, Elsie, enough!" said Lady Grisel,
weeping freely at the mention of her husband,
who had greatly distinguished himself in that
cavalry encounter, where Cromwell's attack on
Edinburgh was so signally repulsed.  "If you
love me, good nurse, I prythee cease these
reminiscences!"
</p>

<p>
"Weel, my lady, but muckle mair could I tell
doo Lilian o' these fearfu' times," continued the
garrulous old woman, who loved (as the Scots all
do) to speak of the dead and other days; "muckle
indeed, for an auld carlin sees unco things in a
lang lifetime.  But, dearsake, your ladyship,
dinna greet sae, for better times <i>will</i> come, and
bethink ye they that thole overcome, for when
things are at the warst, the're sure aye to mend;
sae spake the godly Mr. Bummel to those who
outlived that fearfu' night in the Whigs' vault at
Dunottar."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" said Lilian shuddering, for she thought
of Walter Fenton.  "That was a dark dungeon,
nurse, was it not?"
</p>

<p>
"Deep, and dark, and vaulted, howkit in the
whinrock, yet therein were ane hundred three
score and seventeen o' God's persecuted creatures
thrust, and there they expired in the agony and
thirst, such as the rich man suffered in hell&mdash;where
Lauderdale suffers noo.  Ah, hinnie, it was
a dowie place; the Water-hole of the town guard
is a king's chamber in comparison; it is black,
damp, and slimy as a tod's den."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, madam, it is just in such a place they
have confined poor Walter&mdash;I mean this young
man whom we have involved in our misfortunes,"
said Lilian, in tears and confusion.  "It is ever
before me, since the night you sent me to him.
Dear Aunt Grisel, you cannot conceive all he
endures at present, and is yet to endure."
</p>

<p>
"He is of low birth, Lilian, and therefore
better able than we to endure indignity," said
Lady Bruntisfield, somewhat coldly.  "Yet I
hope he shall not die&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Die!" reiterated Lilian, piqued at her
kinswoman's coolness; "ah, why such a thought?"
</p>

<p>
"I sorrow for him as much as you, Lilian.
The young man seemed good and gentle, with a
bearing far above his humble fortune, and a
comely youth withal."
</p>

<p>
Lilian made no reply, but a close observer
would have perceived that her blue eyes sparkled
and the colour of her cheek heightened with
pleasure as Lady Grisel spoke,
</p>

<p>
"And said he of the council threatened him with
torture?" she continued.
</p>

<p>
"Clermistonlee&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" ejaculated Lady Grisel.
</p>

<p>
"Eh, sirs?" added Elsie.
</p>

<p>
"Clermistonlee," continued Lilian, shuddering,
"would have had him torn limb from limb, but
for the intercession of Claverhouse."
</p>

<p>
"And for what does he hate the youth?"
</p>

<p>
"Permitting me to escape, I presume," replied
Lilian, raising her head with a little hauteur.
</p>

<p>
"Claverse'!" said Elsie, in a low voice; "then
this is the first gude I have heard o' him.  Folk
say he is in league wi' the de'il (Heaven keep us!)
and that when the satanic spirit is in him, his
black een flash like wildfire in a moss-hagg.
Certes!  I'll no forget that fearfu' day when he
would hae dookit me to death for a word or twa."
</p>

<p>
"Colonel Grahame was guilty of most abominable
ungallantry, Elsie; and yet I do not think
he would have ducked me."
</p>

<p>
"Ungallantry, Lilian!" said Lady Grisel, grasping
her cane, "ye should say a breach of law, ye
sillie lassie.  Our barony hath power of pit and
gallows by charter from Robert the Auld Farrand,
and it was a daring act and a graceless, to drag a
vassal from our bounds, when I could have hanged
her myself on the dule-tree, by a word of my
mouth!"  (Elsie winced.)  "But he stood the
youth's friend, you say?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and what dost think, nurse Elsie, so did
old Beardie Dalyel!"
</p>

<p>
"Marvellous! but mind ye the proverb, <i>Hawks
dinna pyke out hawks' een</i>.  The lad wears buff
and steel, and eats his beef and bannock by tuck
of drum; and sae baith Claverse' and Dalyel
shewed him that mercy whilk a sanct o' God's
oppressed kirk, would hae sued in vain wi' clasped
hands and bended knees."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, nurse, you don't know this young man.
He is so mild-eyed and gentle, that Dalyel&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Meinie, ye hizzie, the cakes are scouthering!
Dalyel! folk say his mother was in love wi' the
deil; and my son Hab (a black day it was too
when he first mounted his bandoleers,) ance saw
a kail-stock scorched to the very heart when the
auld knicht spat on it&mdash;but fearfu' men are suited
to fearfu' times."
</p>

<p>
"Hush, Elshender," said Lady Grisel; "they
are indeed times when we must fear the corbies on
the roof, and the swallow under the eaves.  One
might deem the council to have a familiar fiend at
their command, (like that fell warlock Weir, whose
staff went errands,) for nought passes in cot or
castle on this side of the highland frontier, but
straightway they are informed of it.  From whence
could they have tidings that our gallant kinsman
Quentin, and that fule body Bummel were at
Bruntisfield?  Landed at midnight from the Dutch
frigate near the mouth of the lonely Figget Burn,
they were secretly admitted to our house, in
presence only of my baillie and most familiar
servitors, who would not betray me.  I rejoice the
captain hath escaped their barbarities&mdash;but
Ichabod, poor man!&mdash;I suppose his earthly troubles
are well nigh over."
</p>

<p>
"A dreich time he'll have o't on the lonely
Bass," said Meinie, turning the savory cakes, and
blowing her pretty fingers.  "There is naething
there but gulls flapping and skirling, the soughing
wind and roaring waves; but it will be a braw
place to preach in, gif the red-coats let him.  Oh,
it would be the death o' me to be among these
red-coats."
</p>

<p>
"Unless Hab Elshender were one," said Lilian:
and Meinie blushed, for the linking of two names
together has a strange charm to a young heart.
</p>

<p>
"Ou' aye," laughed the light-hearted girl; "but
Maister Ichabod may cool his lugs blawing gospel
owre the craigs, to the north wind, or gieing
the waves a screed o' that blessed "<i>Bombshell</i>,"
he aye havers o'.  Better that than skirling a
psalm at the Bowfoot, till the doomster's axe
comes down wi' a bang, and sends his head
chittering into a basket.  Ugh!'"
</p>

<p>
"Meinie, peace wi' this discourse, whilk beseems
not!" said Elsie with great asperity.  "I
heard the lips o' the godly Renwick pray audibly,
after his head lay in Pate Pincer's basket.  Eh,
sirs! what a head it is <i>now</i>.  Yet the Netherbow
guard watch it wi' cocked matches day and night,
for there is mony a bold plot made by the
Cameronians to carry it awa."
</p>

<p>
"But our unfortunate friend the preacher&mdash;how
dearly, by his crushed limbs, has he paid for
his zeal in the cause of the Dutch prince!  Yet,
as Heaven knoweth, I knew not that letters of
treason to our Scottish nobles were in his
possession, or never would he have darkened the door
of Bruntisfield.  He deceived me; let it pass.
Sir Archibald, thou rememberest well my husband,
Elsie?&mdash;'tis well that he sleeps in his grave.
Oh, judge what <i>he</i> would have thought of our
downfal and degradation!"
</p>

<p>
"My mind misgives me, my lady, but
Sir Archibald's kirk was the fushionless ane o'
episcopacy, and, indeed, he just gaed wherever
the troops marched, with trumpets blawing and
kettle-drums beating waefu' to hear in the day o'
the Lord."
</p>

<p>
This last speech somewhat displeased Lady
Grisel, who struck her cane thrice on the clay
floor, and there ensued a long pause, broken only
by creaking of the beeches in the adjoining grove,
and the birr of Elsie's wheel as it whirled by the
ruddy fire.
</p>

<p>
"Come, your Leddyship," said Elsie, "let
byegones be byegones, and we'll be canty while we
may.  Meinie can sing like a laverock in the
summer morning; sae, lassie, gie forth your best sang
to please our lady, and then we'll hae our luggies
o' milk, and bit o' your bannocks, a screed o' the
blessed gospel, and syne awa to our rest, for its
waxing late."
</p>

<p>
Meinie of course was about to enter some bashful
protest, when the soft voice of her foster-sister
said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Do, dearest Meinie, and I will join thee;
'twill raise the spirits of good aunt Grisel.  Ah,
if I had only my spinnet, the cittern, or even my
flageolet here!"
</p>

<p>
"What is your pleasure, then, Madam Lilian?"
asked Meinie, curtseying, "<i>Lady Anne Bothwell's
Lament</i>, or <i>The Broom of the Cowdenknowes</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"Anything but the last," said Lady Bruntisfield.
"The Knowes of Cowden hath passed
away from the house of Hume, and bonnie
though the golden broom may be, it blooms for us
no more."
</p>

<p>
"Sing '<i>Dunbarton's drums</i>,' Meinie," said
Lilian, "you hum it from morning till evening."
</p>

<p>
"And so do <i>you</i>, Madam," said Meinie slyly
and bluntly; "but I loe the merry measure."
</p>

<p>
"Ewhow, that's because o' my wild son Hab!"
said Elsie, laughing.  "Mak' speed, lassie&mdash;our
lady waits."
</p>

<p>
Meinie made another low old-fashioned curtsey,
and then, while continuing her task, sang the
song and march composed for the Scots Royals,
or Dunbarton's Musqueteers, and which had then
been popular in Scotland for some years.  Lilian
at times added her softer notes to Meinie's, and
their clear voices made the rough rafters, hollow
box-beds, and deep bunkers of the old cottage ring
to that merry old air:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
  "Dunbarton's drums beating bonnie, O,<br />
  Remind me o' my Johnnie, O,<br />
</p>

<p>
added Elsie, beating time with her feet to the
mellow voices of the girls; but Lady Bruntisfield
heard them not, for with her glistening eyes fixed
on the glowing embers, she gradually sunk into
a deep reverie.  Animated each by her own secret
thoughts, the girls sang with tenderness and
enthusiasm, and all were so much engaged that none
of the four perceived a <i>fifth</i> personage, who
suddenly made his appearance among them.
</p>

<p>
In a corner of the cottage stood a great oak
chest, apparently a meal girnel, but having a
false floor, and being in reality the mouth of the
subterranean place of concealment and escape,
communicating with the grove behind the cottage.
Such outlets were numerous in all large mansions;
and the dangerous times of the Solemn League
had caused the umquhile John Elshender to
construct such a sallyport from his humble dwelling;
and on several occasions of peril it had saved him
from being hanged over his own door by Malignants,
Covenanters, and English, or whoever had
the upperhand for the time.  Slowly the girnel lid
was raised, and the glowing firelight shone on the
steel breast-plate and bandoleers of a musqueteer.
He was a ruddy-faced young man, with the prominent
cheek-bones and shrewd expression of the
Lowland peasantry: stout and athletic in figure,
his keen grey eyes took a rapid survey of the
cottage under the peak of his morion.  His face
expressed surprise and curiosity, but as the song
proceeded he stepped slowly and softly out, and
when it was concluded stood close to the rosy and
buxom Meinie.
</p>

<p>
"Hurrah!" he exclaimed, and gave her a
resounding kiss on each cheek.  The wheel fell from
the relaxed hand of Elsie, and a shriek burst from
Lilian, who believed they were betrayed, and threw
herself before her aged kinswoman.
</p>

<p>
"Hab, Hab, ye graceless loon," screamed Elsie,
as her son now kissed her, "how dare ye gliff folk
this gate?"
</p>

<p>
"Hoots, Hab, ye've toozled a' my tap-knot,"
said Meinie, affecting to pout; "ye came on me
noo like a ghaist or a spunkie."
</p>

<p>
"Heyday, Meinie, my doo! ye want to be
kissed again; do ye think I have trailed a pike
these eight years under my Lord Dunbarton,
without learning to tak' baith castles and kimmers
by storm."
</p>

<p>
"Aye-aye, you are as bad as the warst o' them,
I doubt not.  Lasses, indeed&mdash;dinna come near
me again."
</p>

<p>
"Hoity, toity, does she not want another kiss?"
</p>

<p>
"Haud, you wild loon," said his mother, in
great glee; "do ye no see who are present?"
</p>

<p>
"An auld neighbour carlin, I think, and as
bonnie a young lass as I ever saw on the longest
day's march, d&mdash;n me."
</p>

<p>
Halbert suddenly paused, and became very
much perplexed.  The blood rushed into his
swarthy face, as with an awkward but profound
salute he said, in an altered voice,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I crave your pardon a thousand times, noble
madam; and yours, sweet Mistress Lilian.  My
humble duty to ye both, though it is not long
since I had the happiness to meet you.  It goes
to my heart to see you in attire so unbefitting your
station.  O, Lady Grisel, I ken oure well of all
that has come to pass, for I was one of the thirty
files of musqueteers, that were with Finland at the
auld place on that sorrowful night last month.
They are hard times these, my lady."
</p>

<p>
"Fearfu' times, my son," chorussed Elsie.
</p>

<p>
"True, Halbert," said the old lady.  "Ruin
and proscription now level the most noble with
the mean, the most unoffending with the guilty,
and blend all with the common herd.  But, Halbert,
I bid ye welcome, my man, and God bless ye!"
</p>

<p>
"And I too, Habbie," added Lilian; "for I
cannot forget when we bird-nested in the wood
yonder, and gathered gowans and flowers on the
sunny braes in summer.  Oh!  Hab, in all your
soldiering, I will warrant ye have never been so
happy as we were then."
</p>

<p>
The eyes of the soldier glistened.
</p>

<p>
"True it is, madam," said he, as slightly and
bashfully he raised to his lip the beautiful hand
she extended towards him; "true, indeed.  I
have spent many a happy hour under the canvass
tent, and birled many a wine horn merrily in the
Flanders hostels and French cabarets; but never
have I seen such happy hours as those we spent
when we were bairns, amang the oakwoods of the
auld place upbye yonder.  Often hath brave
Mr. Fenton, when tramping by my side on the long
dusty march, recalled their memory in such wise
that my heart swelled under its iron case.  And
truly, honoured madam, though the same heart is
wrung to see you dressed in cousin Meinie's
humble duds, never saw I lassie that looked sae
winsome.  Od rot it! how came your ladyship
to let that ill-omened corbie to darken your door?
when sure ye might have been that dool and
mischief would meet thereafter on your hearthstane.
This goose Bummel&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Hab, ye gomeral, wheesht!" said Elsie,
interrupting this somewhat laboured address.
"Your notions o' ministers are gathered frae your
tearing, swearing, through-ganging, horse-racing,
and hard-drinking Episcopal curates and chaplains,
that swagger about wi' cockades in their bonnets
and swords at their thighs, chucking every bonnie
lass under chin, and gieing ilka sabbath a sleepy,
fushionless, feckless, drouthie, cauldrifed discourse,
whilk hath neither the due birr nor substantious,
soul-feeding effect o' the true gospel, but savours
rather o' the abomination&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ahoi, mother, halt!&mdash;egad, or mind the iron
gags, the fetterlocks, and thumbikins!" cried her
son, with an alarm that was no way lessened by a
violent knocking at the cottage door, where, at
that moment, the iron ring of the risp was drawn
sharply and repeatedly up and down.
</p>

<p>
The hearts of the poor fugitives forgot to beat!
Insult, imprisonment, banishment, or worse,
rushed upon the mind of Lady Bruntisfield; the
dark, gloating eyes and terrible presence of
Clermistonlee, upon that of Lilian: but Halbert
Elshender snatched up his musquet and blew the
match till it glowed on his sun-burned face, an
action which made the women grow paler still.
</p>

<p>
"Beard of the devil!  Get into the girnel, Lady
Grizel; and you, madam Lilian&mdash;quick!"
exclaimed the soldier in a vehement whisper.
</p>

<p>
"Halbert," faltered Lady Bruntisfield, "your
father was a leal and faithful vassal&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And I, his only son, will stand by you and
yours to the death, even as he would have done.
In&mdash;in&mdash;away to the Beech-grove, ere worse come
of it.  Mother, ye donnart jaud, doun wi' the lid,
and pouch the key.  And now, may I run the
gauntlet from right to left, if you (whoever you
are) that tirl the risp so hard get not a taste of
King Jamie's new sweyne-feather!"  He screwed
his dagger or bayonet to the muzzle of his
matchlock, and then demanded in a loud voice&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Stand, stranger.  Who goes there?"
</p>

<p>
"One who must speak with Lady Bruntisfield,
whom I know to be concealed here.  Open, and
without a moment's delay."
</p>

<p>
"Lost&mdash;lost!  Gude Lord, keep thy hand over
<i>them</i> and us!" murmured Elsie, clinging to Meinie,
as another loud and impatient blow shook the
well-barred door, and found a terrible echo in the
trembling hearts of the fugitives and their
protectors.

CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><br />
A REVERSE.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  A fredome is a noble thing!<br />
  Fredome makes man to have liking;<br />
  Fredome al solace to man gives,<br />
  He lives at ease that frely lives.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BARBOUR'S BRUCE.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Walter was still where we left him in the
eleventh chapter, an inmate of the city prison.
</p>

<p>
The gloom, monotony, and degradation affected
his mind, not less than the confinement and
noxious vapours of the place did his health, and he
felt his strength and spirit failing fast.  The
longing for freedom became one moment almost too
intense to be borne, and the next he sank into a
listless apathy, careless alike of liberty and life.
And as his health suffered, and his ardour died
his aspect became (though he knew it not) more
haggard and ghastly on each succeeding day.
</p>

<p>
The recollection of Lilian's midnight visit, alone
threw a ray of light through the gloom of his
clouded fortune; over that event he mused, at
times, with unalloyed pleasure.  Anxiously he
watched every night, animated by a faint hope
that she might come again; but Lilian came no
more.
</p>

<p>
"She came merely to thank me for my service,
and I shall soon be forgotten," he would say; and
then came vividly on his mind, the blight and
disgrace which had been heaped upon him, and the
abyss into which he had been cast.  Keenly and
bitterly he now felt his loneliness in the world.
All this he might have escaped, perhaps, but for
the evil offices of the malevolent Clermistonlee;
and when he contemplated how dim and distant
was the prospect of ever again rising even to his
former humble station, his heart was wrung; for,
with the fetters of a coward and slave, he felt
that he possessed the soul and the fire of a
hero.
</p>

<p>
"Though poor and unpretending, I was a
gentleman, so far as spirit, bearing, and manners
could make me.  I have done nothing that is vile
or dishonourable; but now, after fetters have
dishonoured these hands, and prison-walls enclosed
me, can I ever again look my equals in the face?
Yes! and may I perish, if Randal of Clermistonlee
shall not learn that in time!"
</p>

<p>
He spoke fiercely; for he had now, from very
solitude, acquired a habit of uttering his thoughts
aloud.  He could not suppress his dread that
Lilian Napier, in the present proscribed and
friendless state of her family, might too easily fall
into the toils of that famous and powerful roué,
whose crimes and excesses, in a country so rigidly
moral, were regarded with a horror and detestation,
that made women generally shun his touch as
they passed him in the street, and his glance by
the wayside.  Remembering his parting words,
the bitter threat, and the fierce aspect of his visage
and polecat eyes when he last beheld him, Walter
was justly under considerable apprehension, that
he might again be summoned before the Council,
and either have his sentence altered to one of
greater severity, or have its most degrading clauses
carried into immediate execution.  In fact, Lord
Clermistonlee's temporary indisposition alone
deferred such a catastrophe.  Consequently day after
day passed; the weeks ran on, but he never saw
another face than that of a grim old city-guardsman,
who each morning brought him a coarse
cake, a bowl of porridge, and a pitcher of water;
and, acting strictly to the tenor of his orders,
withdrew without a word of greeting or condolence.
</p>

<p>
Thus day and night rolled on in weary and
intense monotony, and poor Walter by turns grew
more fierce and impatient, or more listless and
apathetic.  Sometimes he dosed and dreamed
away the day, on his bed of damp and fetid straw,
and by night paced slowly the floor of that little
vault, every stone and joint and feature of which,
became indelibly impressed on his memory.
</p>

<p>
But a crisis came sooner than he had anticipated.
</p>

<p>
One night he was roused from a deeper and
heavier slumber than usual by the unwonted light
of a large lamp flashing on his eyes; he started,
awoke, and the glare blinded him for a moment.
Three persons were close beside him.  One was
the odious, sinister, and hard-featured Gudeman
of the establishment; the second was the old
soldier who acted as javelleur; and the third was
a gentleman whose lofty bearing and rich attire
caused Walter to spring at once to his feet.  He
was a dark-complexioned and very handsome man,
bordering on forty years of age; he wore a coat
of rose-coloured velvet, slashed at the breast and
shoulders with white satin; his breeches and
stockings were of spotless white silk; his boots of
pale buff, and accoutred with massive gold spurs.
His voluminous black wig was shaded by his
plumed Spanish hat, the band of which sparkled
with brilliants; while a long rapier, gold-headed
cane and diamond ring showed he was quite a man
of fashion.  It was George Douglas, the gallant
Earl of Dunbarton.
</p>

<p>
"'Sdeath!  Walter, my boy, I little thought to
find you here," said he.  "Faugh! this place is
like the old souterrains of Alsace or Brisgau; yet
here it was that the great Argyle once sojourned!"
</p>

<p>
"My Lord&mdash;my Lord!" exclaimed Walter
joyfully&mdash;"how unexpected is this honour!"
</p>

<p>
"I returned only this forenoon from London."
</p>

<p>
"A long journey and a perilous, my Lord.  I
congratulate you on your safe return."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, my boy.  The Countess suffered
much, she is so delicate, and my private coach,
though carrying only six inside and six without,
(beside our baggage) rumbled so heavily&mdash;but we
were only five weeks on the way&mdash;a very tolerable
journey."
</p>

<p>
"Very; and still, my Lord, I have heard of it
being done in three; but the roads&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"O they are pretty good now, I assure you, till
one reaches the debateable land and the old
boundary road at Berwick.  There are bridges
over most of the rivers too; but the lonely places
swarm with footpads and highwaymen.  Wilt
believe it? we had only one break down by the
way, and two encounters with gentlemen of the
post.  Ah! I winged one varlet near the
Rerecross of Stanmore one night, and to be a soldier's
wife&mdash;egad how the Countess wept!  Immediately
upon my arrival at Bristo, I was waited on by the
Laird of Finland, who told me your story, and, as
Lady Dunbarton would not rest until her young
protégée was at liberty, I had to bestir myself,
and so&mdash;am here."
</p>

<p>
"I am deeply indebted to your dear Countess,
my Lord Earl," replied Walter with glistening
eyes; "I owe her a thousand favours, which I
hope circumstances will never require me to
repay."
</p>

<p>
"Thou art a fine fellow, Walter," replied the
Earl, striking him familiarly on the shoulder;
"and thine inborn goodness of heart gains and
deserves the love of all who know thee.  The
Countess&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"O would that I could thank her now for years
of kindness and protection, when I was a poor
and forlorn little boy!" exclaimed Walter with
deep feeling.
</p>

<p>
"And why not, lad? a coach awaits us at the
close-head, and you are a free man."
</p>

<p>
"Free! my Lord, <i>free</i>!"
</p>

<p>
"Free as the wind, and without a stain on thy
scutcheon."
</p>

<p>
"<i>My</i> scutcheon," repeated Walter coldly.
"Ah, my Lord, why jest with my nameless
obscurity."
</p>

<p>
"Think not so ungenerously of me.  The day
shall come, Walter, when we may see the argent
and bend azure of the old Fentounes of that ilk
(I don't doubt the Lyon Herald will make thee a
sprout of that ancient stock) quartered, collared,
and mantled with your own personal achievements.
Tush, lad! the wide world is all before you, and
you have your sword.  Think how many Scottish
cavaliers of fortune have led the finest armies, and
won the greatest battles, and the proudest titles in
Europe!  I have this moment come from the
Council Chamber, where with half a dozen words,
I have reversed all thy doom, and had it expunged
from their black books."
</p>

<p>
"I would, noble Earl, that the same generosity
had been extended to the Napiers of Bruntisfield."
</p>

<p>
"Nor was it withheld.  What think you of
that beautiful minx Annie Laurie of Maxwelton
(I warrant thou knowest her&mdash;all our gay
fellows do) waylaying me in her sedan.  We met
at the Cowgate Stairs, which ascend to the
Parliament House, and there desiring her linkboys
and liverymen to halt right in that narrow path,
she vowed by every bone in her fan, I should
never get to Council to-night&mdash;ha! ha! unless I
pledged my word as a belted Earl to have her
friends the Napiers pardoned as well as thee.
A brave damsel, faith! and would do well to
follow the drum.  Zooks!  I wish young Finland
had her."
</p>

<p>
"And the Napiers&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Are pardoned; but they have fled, egad! nobody
knows where.  How exasperated Perth,
Balcarris, and other high-flying cavaliers were by
the influence I seemed to possess over the votes
at the Board, having won alike the noble Claverhouse,
the ferocious Dalyel, and that addlepated
senator, Swinton of Mersington."
</p>

<p>
"Lord Dunbarton, I have no words to express
my feelings."
</p>

<p>
"Pshaw! in all this affair I see only the
meanness of the despicable world.  Deeming thee a
poor and friendless lad, whose whole hope was the
fortune of war, and whose only inheritance a
poor half-pike, these blustering Lords of Council
did not hesitate to misuse thee shamefully.  Here
thou art immured and forgotten, until one comes,
on whom they reckoned not, but who, in addition
to a coronet, writes himself Knight of the Thistle,
Commander of the Scottish Forces, and Colonel
of a devoted regiment of fifteen hundred brave
hearts as ever marched to battle, and lo! his
wish is law, his breath bears all before it.  Walter
Fenton, have a soul above the petty injuries of
lordlings such as these, and cock thy feather not
a whit the less for having endured their
jack-in-office frowns."
</p>

<p>
Here the Gudeman rattled his keys, and awe
alone kept his constitutional impatience in check.
</p>

<p>
"And how did your Lordship overcome the
hatred of Clermistonlee, my most bitter persecutor?"
</p>

<p>
"O, he is quite a devil of a fellow that!  Ha! ha!
He got a rapier thrust a few nights ago,
which has luckily confined him to his apartments,
and deprived the Council of his pleasant company
and amiable advice.  Ah, he is a brave fellow,
too, Clermistonlee; but though an expert swordsman
and accomplished cavalier, he is, withal, too
much of a roué and fanfaron for my taste.  And,
harkee, Walter, I have one request to make ere
we leave this abominable souterrain; that you
will have no recourse to arms, for the severity with
which as a Privy Councillor he may have treated
you."
</p>

<p>
"Your Lordship's wish was ever a law to me;
but if I am set upon&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Zounds! then spare not to thrust and slash
while hand and hilt will hold together," said the
Earl, as they ascended the spiral stair of the
prison, preceded by the gudeman thereof, who
never ceased bowing until they issued into the
dark and narrow alley then named Gourlay's or
Mauchane's Close.  Walters heart beat joyously,
and his pulse quickened as the cool night wind
blew upon his blanched but flushing cheek.
</p>

<p>
"He must have been a thoroughpaced tyrant,
the constructor of this den of thine, gudeman,"
said the Earl, surveying the prison as he handed
some silver to the governor; "but I suppose we
must pay largess nevertheless;" and, taking the
arm of his companion, they ascended the steep
alley together.  "You have followed my drums
now, Walter; for, let me see&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Since Candlemas-tide '85, my Lord."
</p>

<p>
"How, boy&mdash;for three years?"
</p>

<p>
"Ever since you defeated Argyle's troops at the
Muirdykes," said Walter with a sigh.
</p>

<p>
"Hah!&mdash;is it so?  I have been somewhat forgetful
of thee in these bustling times, but shall make
immediate amends.  I have promoted many a
slashed and feathered ruffler when thy quiet merit
was passed unheeded.  You fought under Halkett at
Sedgemoor: it was a well-ordered field that, and
had Lord Gray's horse properly flanked Monmouth's
infantry, their Lordships of Feversham
and Churchill, might have had another tale to tell
at St. James's.  S'death! we are likely soon to
have such scenes again, for there will be a
convulsion in our politics that will make and unmake
many a fair name and noble patrimony."
</p>

<p>
"This is a riddle to me, my Lord."
</p>

<p>
"So much the better&mdash;my suspicions would be
called treason to King James by the Lords of the
Laigh Chamber.  Our Scottish troops are
concentrating fast round Edinburgh from the West
and Borders&mdash;even our frontier garrison at
Greenlaw is withdrawn here, so perhaps the Northumbrian
thieves will get out their horns again, as they
did in Cromwell's time after that day of shame at
Dunbar.  You will come with me to Bristo, of
course?" continued the Earl, as they issued into
that main street which runs the whole length of
the old city, and was long deemed for its bustle,
breadth, height, and variety of architecture the
most striking in Europe.
</p>

<p>
Then it was silent and empty, for the hour was
late; the countless windows of the lofty mansions
which shot up to a giant height on each side, in
every variety of the Scottish and Flemish tastes,
with fantastic fronts, of wood or stone, turreted,
corbelled and corbie-stoned, gable-ended, balconied,
and bartizanned, were dark and closed, or lighted
only by the silver moon which bathed one side of
the street in a flood of pale white lustre, while
the other was immersed in obscure and murky
shadow.  The long vista of the Lawnmarket was
closed by the gloomy and picturesque masses of the
great gothic cathedral, the façade of the Tolbooth,
and the high narrow edifices of the Craimes, a
street wedged curiously between St. Giles and
the place now occupied by the Exchange.
</p>

<p>
A hackney-coach like a clumsy herse, one of
the few introduced into Edinburgh only fifteen
years before, and consequently deemed a splendid
and luxurious mode of locomotion, stood at the
mouth of the Pend or archway.  The driver, a
tall, gaunt fellow, dressed in a plain gaberdine of
that coarse stuff, with which a recent Act of the
Scottish Parliament compelled the humbler classes
to content themselves, stood bonnet in hand by
the heavy flight of steps which enabled first the
Earl and then Walter to ascend into the recesses
of the vehicle.  The door was closed with deliberation;
the driver clambered into his place on the
roof, and slowly and solemnly his two horses
dragged the lumbering machine up the Lawn-market,
over the rough and steep causeway of
which it rumbled like a vast caravan.
</p>

<p>
"We make great advances in the art of luxury,
we moderns," said the Earl; "Ah! twenty years
ago there was nothing of this sort!  And there
is that new invention, the snaphaunce-lock, which
is as likely to supersede the good old match, as
the screw-hilted dagger of Bayonne is to eclipse
the glories of the old sweynes-feather.  Were you
ever in one of these Dutch conveyances before,
Walter?"
</p>

<p>
"Once only, my Lord, when I accompanied
Lady Dunbarton to Her Grace of Lauderdale's
levee at Holyrood."
</p>

<p>
"Though our preachers inveigh bitterly against
them, as dark places wherein to cloak wickedness
and knavery, and in opposition uphold the good
old fashions of saddles, pillions, and sedans, I
think this is a pleasant and a useful contrivance
withal."
</p>

<p>
"But will you be pleased to remember that my
present attire is a very unfitting one for the
presence of the Countess?&mdash;soiled as it is by the
contaminations of that noxious vault&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Right, Walter&mdash;and I had forgotten that my
little Lætitia is somewhat fatigued with her
journey.  You can pay your devoirs in the
morning, and tell Finland, Gavin of that Ilk, the
Chevalier Drumquhasel, and such other of my
cavaliers as have arrived in the city, that we shall
be glad to see them at our morning déjeûné at
Bristo.  I have ordered a glorious bombarde of
choice canary to be set abroach; so don't forget
to tell them that.  But anent the Napiers,"
continued the earl, "they are intimate friends of
yours, I presume?"
</p>

<p>
"Friends!" stammered Walter; "alas, my lord,
do you think that the proud and stately old Lady
of Bruntisfield, would rank a poor and obscure lad
like me among her friends?  Save your noble self
and the Countess, I have no friends on earth&mdash;none."
</p>

<p>
"Ungrateful rogue! thou forgettest thy fifteen
hundred comrades, each of whom is a friend.
But by all the devils, there is a mystery in this!
'Tis quite a romance.  What tempted you to run
tilt against the council in this matter?  No
answer.  It will not pass muster with me,
Mr. Fenton.  A pretty damoiselle is enough, I know,
to tempt any young gallant to swerve from his
strict line of duty.  I found it so in my bachelor
days.  There is old Mackay of Scoury, who now
commands our Scots in the service of the
States'-General, openly deserted from us in Holland
(when we followed the banner of Condé), and
joined the enemy&mdash;for what? ha, ha! the love of
a rosy little Dutch housewife, who had gained his
weak side, the Lord knows how; for we Scots
musqueteers considered ourselves great connoisseurs
in women, wine, and horse-flesh.  Apropos! of
Lilian Napier&mdash;I doubt not you know where
this little one is concealed."
</p>

<p>
"I do, my lord," answered Walter, with vivacity.
</p>

<p>
"Heydey!  I am right, then," laughed the gay
nobleman, "you got a kiss, I warrant.  <i>Point
d'argent point de Suisses!</i> as we used to say of
the Swiss gendarmerie, ha, ha!"
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, and the consciousness of doing a
generous act, were my sole reward."
</p>

<p>
"Very likely; but I'll leave the Countess to
worm the secret out of thee.  Ha, ha! 'tis very
unlikely that a young spark would peril his life
thus, and look only for a Carthusian's reward
from a dazzling damoiselle of eighteen.  Ho!  I
had served under Turrene, Luxembourg, and
Condé, long ere I was thy age, and know well
that a bright eye and ruddy lip&mdash;but here is the
gate of the Upper Bow, and two fresh heads
grinning on its battlement since I saw it last.
Whose are they?"
</p>

<p>
"Holsterlee and some of his comrades dispersed
a conventicle among the Braid hills lately."
</p>

<p>
"Poor rogues!  If you do not mean to accompany
me; we must part here; and in the course of
to-morrow, if you know where the ladies of yonder
old castle at Bruntisfield are in concealment, you
will doubtless acquaint them with the decree I
have obtained in their favour.  But their kinsman,
Quentin Napier, can neither be pardoned nor
relaxed from the horn."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis well," thought Walter.
</p>

<p>
The Bow, a steep winding street that descended
the southern side of the hill on which the old
city stands, was then closed by a strong gate
called the Upper Porte, under the shadow of
which the coach stopped.  On the right a heavy
Flemish house projected over the street, on
beams of carved wood; on the left, the house of
Weir the wizard frowned its terrors across the
narrow way.  A sentinel opened the creaking
barrier, received the nightly toll, and Walter,
after bidding adieu to the generous Earl, was
about to retire, when the latter called him back.
</p>

<p>
"Harkee, Fenton; you have far to go, and in
these times, when soldiers are openly murdered
in the streets, my rapier may be of some service
should any quarrelsome ruffler cross your path;
take it, for I have pistols."
</p>

<p>
"A thousand thanks, my lord," replied Walter,
receiving from the Earl a long and richly chased
rapier sheathed in crimson velvet.
</p>

<p>
He threw the embroidered belt over his shoulder,
and strode away with a feeling of pride and
elation, to find himself once more a free and
armed man; while the great caravan occupied by
the earl, rumbled down the windings of the
narrow street with increased speed, waking all the
echoes of its hollow stone staircases, and scaring
those indwellers who heard them through their
dreams; all sounds heard by night in the Bow
being fraught with imaginary terrors, and attributed
to the wandering spirit of that diabolical
wizard, who a short time before had expiated
his real and supposed enormities amid a blaze of
tar barrels on the castle hill, and whose
uninhabited mansion was then viewed with horror, as
it is still with curiosity.
</p>

<p>
With a heart brimming with exultation, and
glowing with anticipations of happiness, which
for the time made the revolving world in all its
features shine like a beautiful kaleidoscope, Walter
pirouétted and danced down the Lawnmarket and
through the narrow Craimes.  Was it possible
that but an hour ago he was so very wretched and
degraded?  Was it not all a dream, this new joy,
a dream from which he feared to awake?  Ah,
thought he, one requires to have tasted the bitterness
of captivity, to know the value and the glory
of freedom.
</p>

<p>
Again he wore a sword, and the consciousness
of bearing arms and having the spirit to use them,
imparted to the cavaliers of other times a bearing,
to which the gentlemen of the present age are
strangers.
</p>

<p>
As the clanking wicket of the Netherbow closed
behind him, the flap of a night-bird's wing caused
an involuntary thrill of disgust; he looked up to
the central tower of the Porte, and, faugh! a huge
gled was winging away heavily from the iron
spike whereon a hideous head scowled at the
passers, and by the tangled locks that waved on
the midnight wind around its sweltering features,
Walter thought he recognised the face of the
preacher, Ichabod Bummel, of whose fate he was
still in ignorance.  With pity and disgust he
hurried on, and, without molestation or
adventure, reached his quarters in the White Horse
Cellar&mdash;the place where this eventful narrative
commenced a few weeks before&mdash;a spacious and
ancient but long-forgotten inn, situated at the
bottom of a small court opening from the
Canongate.  Rising from a great arcade, which formed
of old the Royal Mews, this edifice is now
remarkable only for its antiquity and picturesque
aspect, its gables of carved wood, perforated with
pigeon-holes, its enormous stacks of chimneys,
and curious windows on the roof.  At the time of
our tale, there was always a body of troops
billetted there, greatly to the annoyance of Master
Gibbie Runlet, the host thereof, who found them
neither the most peaceful nor profitable
occupants of his premises.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV.
<br /><br />
WALTER AND LILIAN.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  She's here! yet O! my tongue is at a loss;<br />
  Teach me, some power, that happy art of speech,<br />
  To dress my purpose up in gracious words,<br />
  Such as may softly steal upon her soul.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The whole of the next day passed ere Walter
Fenton found time to visit the fugitives; he was
anxious to be the first bearer of the good tidings
confided to him by the Earl, and luckily intelligence
did not travel very fast in those days.  In
Edinburgh there was but one occasional
broadsheet or newspaper, "The Kingdoms Intelligencer,"
and a house situated a mile or two from
the city wall, was deemed a day's journey, distant
among wood, rocks, and water.  Thus the rural
residences of the Napiers, Lord Clermistonlee, Sir
John Toweris of Inverleith, Sir Patrick Walker,
of Coates, and others, were situated in places over
which the busy streets and crowded squares of
the extended city have spread like the work of
magic.
</p>

<p>
Walter had some difficulty in discovering the
exact locality of Elsie's cottage, which was
situated among a labyrinth of haw and privet hedges,
and consequently the evening was far advanced
before he presented himself at her humble abode,
and caused the consternation described in a
preceding chapter.
</p>

<p>
"I must speak instantly with those who are
concealed here," said he; "I am a friend of the
Lady Bruntisfield&mdash;the bearer of most happy
tidings."
</p>

<p>
"I think I should know your voice," said Hab,
still deliberating, and puffing at his match.
</p>

<p>
"And I thine, Halbert Elshender; I am one of
Lord Dunbarton's men."
</p>

<p>
"Welcome, Mr. Fenton!" exclaimed Hab, undoing
the door briskly; "I wish you much joy of
being out of yonder devilish scrape."
</p>

<p>
"How are you back so soon, Hab?  By my
faith, I thought you were browbeating the
westland Whigs, and roystering at free quarters among
the stiffnecked carles of Clydesdale."
</p>

<p>
"And so we were, sir, for three blessed weeks.
Cocks' nails! ilka man was lord and master, and
mair of the billet he had, loundering the gudeman,
kissing the gudewife, and eating the best in
cellar and ambrie, and then settling the lawing
with a flash of a bare blade or a roll on the drum,
as Finland and yourself have dune too.  But
hech! things are likely to be otherwise; it's a bad
sign when the nonconformist bodies begin to cock
their bonnets in face of the king's soldiers, as
they are doing now."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, 'tis thought there will be the devil to
pay between King James and the English, who
were ever jealous of the Stuart rule.  The Ladies
of Bruntisfield are here, are they not?"
</p>

<p>
"Maybe sae, and maybe nae," replied Hab
cunningly, still keeping his match cocked.
</p>

<p>
"How!" asked Walter, frowning, upon which
Elsie cried in great alarm,
</p>

<p>
"Eh, sirs,&mdash;Hab, Hab, ye gomeral, speak the
gentleman fair."
</p>

<p>
"To be plain, Mr. Fenton," asked Halbert
bluntly, "came ye here as friend or foe?"
</p>

<p>
"A late question, when I am within arm's
length of you.  Halbert Elshender, I pledge my
honour I am here in honest friendship."
</p>

<p>
"And quite alone, sir?'
</p>

<p>
"The deuce!  Sirrah, I am as you see,"
responded Walter impatiently.  "Mistress Lilian
is here, and her noble kinswoman too, I doubt
not."
</p>

<p>
Hab winked knowingly, and knocked on the
panels of the vast girnel, the front of which he
opened, and the two fugitives forth stepped, pale
and agitated.  The first sight of Walter's
military garb startled them; but bowing profoundly,
he said, in the formal fashion of the time,
</p>

<p>
"Lady Bruntisfield, your most obedient humble
servant&mdash;Mistress Lilian, yours."
</p>

<p>
"Your servant, sir," muttered the ladies, and
they all bowed to each other three several times.
Lilian blushed deeply.
</p>

<p>
"Ah," said Walter, "I have then the happiness
to be remembered."
</p>

<p>
Lady Grisel, on adjusting her spectacles,
immediately recognized him, and held out her hand
with a smile, in which hauteur, kindness, and
timidity were curiously blended.
</p>

<p>
"Welcome, young gentleman; though our fortunes
are somewhat clouded now, I rejoice their
shadow has not long blighted yours, and I
congratulate you on your restoration to liberty."
</p>

<p>
"And I, in turn, wish you every joy at a
sudden change of fortune.  The decrees of Council
are reversed; your lands, your liberty, your coat
armorial, are restored, and you are free to return
to the ancestral dwelling of your family whenever
it pleases you; to cast aside for ever that humble
attire, though, believe me, fair Lilian, it never
appeared to me so graceful or charming as at this
moment."
</p>

<p>
Again Lilian blushed deeply; her bright eyes
were full of inquiry and expression; her cherry
mouth, half open, displayed the whiteness of her
firm little teeth, and she never appeared so
fascinating to Walter as, when laying her hand gently
on his arm, she said,
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Mr. Fenton, is this indeed true?"
</p>

<p>
Of its truth the old lady appeared to have
some doubts.  She remained for a few moments
silent and motionless.  Her first thought was one
of rapture; her second of surprise and distrust,
for might not this be a wile of Clermistonlee? might
not the price of the young man's liberty be
their betrayal to the Council?  But no! she
suppressed the ungenerous thought, when, bending
her keen eyes on Walter, she read the openness
and candour expressed in his handsome face.
</p>

<p>
"This is indeed a reverse!  O what joy!" she
exclaimed; "and yet 'tis strange," she added,
striking her cane with great energy on the clay
floor; "very strange withal, that no macer, usher,
herald, or deputation of Council hath come to me
with intimation hereof.  This is marvellous
discourtesy in the Earl of Perth, to a dame of honour,
who hath had the privilege of the tabouret before
the Queens of France and Britain.  Young man,
were you specially commissioned to tell me this
happy intelligence?"
</p>

<p>
"Not exactly," said Walter, colouring in turn;
"but it is so pleasant to be the herald of joy, that
I am glad another has not anticipated me.  Indeed,
as the reversal of your sentence was publicly
proclaimed at the cross this forenoon, by the
Albany Herald and Unicorn pursuivant, with
tabard and trumpet, I am astonished you have not
heard of it.  But honest Hab's reluctance to
admit me&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"O teach me to be thankful," exclaimed Lady
Grisel, raising her bright grey eyes and clasped
hands to Heaven; "to be grateful for this great
and singular mercy!  Then all our persecution is
over?"
</p>

<p>
"My dear madam, it is so, and for ever."
</p>

<p>
Another burst of acclamation from Hab shook
the cottage, and he kissed Meinie again in the
excess of his exultation.
</p>

<p>
"O nurse Elsie, my dream is read," said Lady
Grisel.  "Last night I thought I saw Sir Archibald's
favourite horse&mdash;ye mind his auld trooper,
spotless Snawdrift.  A white steed, ye know, Elsie,
betokens intelligence; and his being spurgalled
shewed it would be speedy.  His saddle was girth
uppermost&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Whilk boded luck, and never mair may it
leave the house o' Bruntisfield, thanks to the
battling Lord!" said Elsie, piously.
</p>

<p>
"I am unused to receive boons," said the stately
dame; "but would be glad to know to what or to
whom the house of Napier is indebted for this
signal favour of fortune."
</p>

<p>
"To my generous Lord and Colonel, the princely
Dunbarton, whom God long preserve!  Here
are the pardon and reversed decree of forfeiture;
I received them from his countess, who desired
me to bear them to you with her best regards."
</p>

<p>
"O, Mr. Fenton!" exclaimed Lady Grisel,
whose artificial pride now quite gave way before
the natural warmth and gratitude of her heart.
And her broad silver barnacles became dim with
tears as she received the documents which bore the
well-flourished signature, "Perth, Cancellarius,"
and the seal of Council.  "God knows, good
youth," she continued, pressing Walter's hand in
her's, "that if I repined much at the sad
occurrences of the last few weeks, it was for the sake
of this fair child alone.  Alake! at her age to be
thrown into poverty and obscurity were to die a
living death&mdash;but now&mdash;"  Lilian, in a transport
of tears and joy, threw her arms around her aged
relative and kissed her.
</p>

<p>
"Poverty and obscurity!" thought poor Walter;
"How can I dare to love a being so far above
me, when these are all I have to share with her?"
</p>

<p>
With her snood unbound and her bright hair
flying in beautiful disorder, the lively girl rushed
from Elsie to Meinie alternately kissing and
embracing them, till honest Hab began to rub his
mouth with his cuff in expectation of the favour
going round; and in her girlish delight, she seemed
a thousand times more charming than when clad
in her long stomacher, and compelled to imitate
Lady Grisel's starched decorum and old-fashioned
stateliness of demeanour.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, good Heavens," she suddenly exclaimed,
"we are quite forgetting poor cousin Quentin."
</p>

<p>
"The deuce take cousin Quentin!" thought
Walter, and he hastened to inform her that the
Council had resolved to cut the Captain into joints
the moment they could lay hands on him.
</p>

<p>
Meinie, whose cakes had long since been
scorched to a cinder, now gave Hab a box on the
ear, and retreating from him with a pout of rustic
coquetry, placed several three-legged stools near
the fire, around which they seated themselves by
desire of Lady Grisel, herself occupying the great
elbow-chair, against which her tall walking-cane
was placed by Elsie with great formality.  The
venerable cottager was very lavish in her praises
of Walter, for whom, as the bearer of such good
tidings, she felt a cordial admiration; and, heedless
of Lilian's confusion, continued to whisper it
in her ear.
</p>

<p>
"A handsome cavalier, hinny.  Saw ye ever
sic een?&mdash;they glint like a gosshawk's.  His hair
is like the corbie's wing wi' the dew on it; and
his cheeks are like red rowan berries.  He is
indeed a winsome young gallant, my doo Lilian!&mdash;no
ane o' our law-breakers, who spend the
blessed Sabbath in ruffling through the streets in
masks and mantles, or dicing, drinking, or playing
at shovel-board in a vile change-house, or playing
at pell-mell like the godless Charles; but a
gospel-fearing and discreet youth, as gude as he's bonnie,
I doubtna."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, hush, Elsie!&mdash;he will hear you," said
Lilian in a breathless voice.
</p>

<p>
"What did you say his name is, hinny?" asked
Elsie, who was rather deaf.
</p>

<p>
"I never said," whispered Lilian; "but it is
Walter Fenton&mdash;a pretty one, is it not, nurse?"
</p>

<p>
"Fenton?&mdash;he'll be ane o' the auld Fentons
owre the water; as gallant and stalwart a race as
ever Fifeshire saw."
</p>

<p>
"I hope so," sighed Lilian; "but, oh Elsie! there
is some sad mystery about this poor young
man.  When a very little child, he was found
nestled in his dead mother's bosom in the kirk-yard
of the Greyfriars, in that terrible time you
will remember?"
</p>

<p>
"My bonnie bairn, it was indeed a fearfu' time;
but, by his winsome face, I warrant him come o'
gentle kin."
</p>

<p>
"Dost think so, dear nursie?"
</p>

<p>
"Not Claver'se himsel has an eye that glints
wi' mair pride, or a lip that curls mair haughtily.
True gentle blood can aye be kent by the curl o'
the lip.  I warrant his blude's as gude as ony in
braid Scotland."
</p>

<p>
"Oh; 'tis for that I pity and love him so much,"
said Lilian artlessly.  As she spoke, Walter, who
was conversing with Lady Grisel, unexpectedly
looked full towards her; he had removed his steel
cap, and the long black locks beneath it flowed in
cavalier profusion over his scarlet doublet.  He
never looked so prepossessing; and, fearing that
he had overheard her, the cheek of the timid girl
grew scarlet and then deadly pale; and to hide
her confusion, she bent her face towards the old
nurse, requesting her to bind up her hair.
</p>

<p>
"In ringlets and heart-breakers such as never
Maister Pouncet fashioned, shall I twine thy
bonnie gowden hair to-morrow, hinny," said the
old woman, kissing with fond respect the white
forehead of Lilian; for those were days when the
highest and the lowest classes in Scotland were
bound together by such endearing ties as never
will exist again.  "And nae mair shall your dainty
arms and jimpy waist be bound wi' aught but
Naples silk and three-pile taffeta."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! nurse Elsie, if my heart is always as
happy and light as Meinie's, it will matter little
what I wear."
</p>

<p>
"Sae said your lady mother, that's dead and
gane; yea, and your great-aunt Grisel too (but
silk and damask are grand braws, hinny!): and,
waes me! thae wrinkled auld hands hae braided
the bonnie hair o' baith.  And now the head o'
ane is turned frae the hue o' the raven's wing to
that o' the new-fa'n snaw; and the head o' the
other, oh, waly! waly! lies low in the kirk vaults
o' St. Rocque.  I mind a time when the hair o'
my lady there was as glossy as yours; yea, and
her brow as smooth, and her cheek glowing like
the red rowan berry.  It is many a lang and weary
year ago, and yet it seemeth but as yesterday, when
your kinsman, umquhile Sir Archibald, first cam
riding up the dykeside to Cowdenknowes, wi' my
puir gudeman, John Elshender, astride his cloak-bags
on a high trotting mear; and weel I mind
the time when first he drew his chair in by the
ingle, and lookit awfu' things at Lady Grisel.
Certes, but she was ill to please at her toilet after
that!  Frae morning till e'enin' there was nought
but busking wi' braws, frizzling and puffing and
perfuming; tying and untying, and flaunting wi'
breast-knots and fardingales, and working wi'
essence o' daffodils and gilliflower water.  That
was mony a year before that vile limmer Cromwell
led his ill-faured host on this side o' the
English bounds.  He was a braw and a buirdly
man Sir Archibald, though when last he rode forth
frae the aikwoods o' the auld Place owre the muir,
his pow was lyart enough.  Methink I see him
yet, as I saw him first, our brave auld laird!  His
green doublet o' taffeta, stiff wi' buckram,
bombast, and gowden lace&mdash;his lang buff boots and
clanking spurs&mdash;his broadsword and dudgeon-knife&mdash;and
a bonnie ger-falcon on his nether
wrist, wi' a plume on its head and siller varvels
on its legs.  Mony a sair gloom he gaed that
braw chield, the Laird o' Caickmuir; but Lady
Grisel could never thole the Muirs, for they gained
baith haugh and holm by pinglin' wi' base
merchandise in Nungate o' Haddintoun, when the
Humes were winning the broomy knowes o'
Cowden by the sharp spur and the long spear&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"In fearfu' times, Elsie," said Lilian laughing.
</p>

<p>
"Ay, indeed, hinny," continued the garrulous
old woman.  "Fearfu' times they were, when the
Lord o' Crichton, wi' his fierce knights in their
bright armour, on barbed horses, ravaged a' the
West-kirk parochin to the castle-gate of Corstorphin,
ruining lord, laird, and tenant body alike,&mdash;giving
the cottar's home, the baron's tower, and
the priest's kirk to torch and sack.  Fearfu' times
they ever are, hinny, when Scottish braves and
Scottish blades are bent on ilk ither in the fell
stoure o' battle."
</p>

<p>
"Elshender," said Lady Grisel&mdash;(interrupting
these reminiscences, of which the reader is perhaps
as tired as Lilian was)&mdash;"you have left the band
on your wheel."
</p>

<p>
"Save us and sain us!" exclaimed the old
woman, hobbling to her wheel.  "The last time I
did sae, the gude neighbours span on't the haill
night, and ravelled a' my gude hawslock woo."
</p>

<p>
"Thou shouldst be more careful, Elshender,"
said Lady Grisel gravely.  "It bodes ill luck;
and a red thread should be tied to the rock.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Red thread and Rowan tree,<br />
  Mak' warlock, witch, and fairy flee.<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
I marvel, Lilian, that your friend and gossip,
Annie Laurie, came not to visit us the moment
she heard the proclamation of our innocence, and
the Council's injustice."
</p>

<p>
"Dear Annie was the first to fly hither when
our fortune was at the lowest ebb," said Lilian
timidly.  "Ah, Heaven, if she should be ill!  She
knows how welcome are the bearers of happy
tidings."
</p>

<p>
"And most welcome is Mr. Fenton!" said the
old lady, pressing his hand so kindly that Walter's
heart leaped, and he scarcely dared to glance at
Lilian.  "Dear child, I tremble to think of all
you have braved for our sake,&mdash;the torture,
the bodkin, the dungeon!  It was noble and
generous.  The hero of the old romance, Sir
Roland of Roncesvalles, could not have done
more."
</p>

<p>
"Spare me the shame of these thanks, madam.
The honour of serving your ancient house is
sufficient requital to one so&mdash;so nameless as I am.
But, pray remember it is to my very good lord,
the noble Dunbarton, you alone owe this happy
change in fortune."
</p>

<p>
"And to-morrow, so early as decorum will
permit, and when our servitors can attend in such
state as befits our quality, shall he and his gentle
Countess (English though she be) receive our best
thanks.  The Lady Lætitia is the first of her
nation," she added, and down went the cane on
the floor; "yea, the first that Grisel Hume could
ever thole.  Lilian, we will immediately set forth
on our return to the Place of Bruntisfield."
</p>

<p>
"You will permit me to have the honour of
escorting you, madam?"
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, Mr. Fenton.  There is a troop of
horse at free quarters on the barony; and if&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"They belonged to Dalyel's Grey dragoons.
They were withdrawn by the decree of Council;
and I heard their kettledrums beating through the
city this evening."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis well.  Then we will return by coach, as
it would be unseemly to do so on foot.  We have
long incommoded you, my poor Elshender."
</p>

<p>
"Gude, your ladyship, think not of it," replied
Elsie; "all I hae is yours, and mair would be if I
had it.  I and mine ate of your bread and drank
of your cup in prosperity, and may shame and
dishonour fall on our grey hairs if in adversity we
fail in our duty to the Napiers o' Bruntisfield!"  Elsie wept:
"and you especially, Hab, ye mickle gomeral, wi' the king's
cockade in your bonnet!"
</p>

<p>
"Burganet, ye mean, Lucky; we soldiers of the king wear
braw burganets of bright steel."
</p>

<p>
"But these are fearfu' times, my lady, when the superior is
beholden to the vassal for a roof to cover them, and a
mouthfu' o' meat; but think o't, madam; the auld house is
dark and empty, and the auld survitors are scattered owre
the barony among the tenantry, and the keys o' the barbican
gate are owre the muir wi' the ground baillie, auld Sym o' the
Greenhill."
</p>

<p>
"That loitering runnion should have been the first to
present himself before us!" exclaimed Lady Grizel; "but I
care not; let Hab and Meinie accompany us now, for our
attire is too unseemly for appearance in daylight.  I am
impatient to return; for O, Elsie, thou knowest well this night
is the old returning anniversary of my marriage and the
laird's death, and dost think I will spend it under another
roof than that of Bruntisfield, if I can avoid it?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course not, my lady&mdash;but ewhow!  I'll be alone in this
auld cot, to be scared by spunkies or gyre earlins, for there is
no' a place in a' the Lowdens for deid-lichts, bodochs, and
unco' things, like the auld massemongers' kirk doun the loan
there."
</p>

<p>
"Peace, Elsie! and remember that there lie the bones of
the Napiers for ten generations.  Lay the bible on the table
when we go," said Lady Grizel, with solemnity, "and place a
four-leaved clover and rowan-tree sprig over the fireplace, and,
dost hear me, Elshender, lay the poker and shovel crosswise
above the gathering peat&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Crosswise?" muttered Elsie; "doth not that pertain to
the auld papistical leaven o' idolatry?"
</p>

<p>
"It doth, I own, but the sign of the cross is a right good
charm against the machinations of the evil one.  You must
have found that one made with red chalk on the bed-head,
keepeth away both cramp and nightmare.  My honoured
mother used these marks, and by advice of Quentin, the
abbot of Crossregal.  O, Elshender, that is a long, long time
ago, yet I mind it as yesterday."
</p>

<p>
"Cocksnails!" muttered Hab; "a jovial stoup of Barbadoes
kill-devil were a far better charm, and I douot not the
abbot would have thought so too, eh, Master Fenton?"
</p>

<p>
"Dear nurse," said Lilian, "surely one so harmless and so
pious as thee need fear nothing."
</p>

<p>
"Had ye heard the bummel o' the fairy boy's drum amang
the lang grass in the loan and the stocks o' the hairst fields,
brave though your bluid be, Lilian, it would turn, even as
water.  But if Lady Grizel requireth service of Hab and
Meinie, it beseems no' the wife o' auld John Elshender to
grudge it.  Mony a year I have dwelt here, lang before the
mirk Monanday, and ne'er saw aught that was unco, but I
canna get owre my fears, though there is a horseshoe on the
door where my puir gudeman nailed it forty years ago; there
is a sprig o' rowan-tree owre the lintel, and the heart o' an
elfshotten nowte, birselled wi' wax, and stuck fu' o' pins under
the door step."
</p>

<p>
"A grand charm, Elsie," said Lady Grizel gravely; "no
evil thing can enter or prevail against it."
</p>

<p>
"And so with these notable allies, gudewife, you think
you will face out the terrors of one night alone?" said Walter
impatiently, for soldiering had rubbed off much of that
superstition which still exists in Scotland.
</p>

<p>
"I have courage to do whatever my lady requires o' me as
her bounden vassal," replied Elsie sharply; "courage! my
certie! young sir, mony a lang year before you saw the light,
I learned to look without blenching on steel flashing in my
ain kailyard, and battle-smoke rowing owre holm and hollow.
A Scottish wife, maun, needs hae courage in thae fearfu'
times, when never a day passes without a son, a gudeman, or
a brother having to buckle on steel cap and corslet whenever
the laird cries, 'Mount and ride!'  How mony a time and oft
has the bale fire at Libberton-peel, and the cry o' 'Horse and
spear!' made my douce gudeman crawl out frae his cosy nest
in that bein boxbed, wi' a heavy curse on the English, the
nonconformists, or malignants (or whaever kept the countryside
astir for the time), then donning morion, jack and spear,
he rode awa, de'il kens where, at Sir Archibald's bidding, for
they were aye together in drumming and dirdum, trooping
and travelling, hunting and hosting, sic as may we never see
again!  But alake! there is a whisper gaing owre the land,
that waur is yet to come than the wildest persecutor could
think o'."
</p>

<p>
"Beard o' Mahoun!" said Hab impatiently, "you are at
your weary auld-world stories again.  Let all bygones be
forgotten, mother, and as for the trooping and tramping of
those days, when my faither rode by laird's bridle, God send
we may soon have the same again!  But if our Lady means
to return to the old place to-night, the sooner she sets out the
better."
</p>

<p>
"True, Halbert," said Lady Grizel, "for the hour waxes
late; but," she added, striking her cane on the floor, "we
will require a coach, for, late or early, we must return in such
state as befits us."
</p>

<p>
"Hab," said Walter, "hurry to the Portsburgh, and desire
the master of the inn there immediately to send his hackney
coach (I know he keeps one), with horses to drag it, and
link-boys conform."
</p>

<p>
"He is a dour auld carl, I ken," replied Hab, throwing off
his bandoleers, and preparing to start.  "Our inquartering
there a month ago, has neither improved his temper or
gudewill.  It will be the dead hour of night when I tirl his
pin, and he may refuse to obey me."
</p>

<p>
"How, if you say the coach is for a lady of quality."
</p>

<p>
"For <i>me</i>, Halbert?" added Lady Grizel with dignity.
</p>

<p>
"Ay, madam, and ask my authority."
</p>

<p>
"Then show him the blade of your sword," said Walter:
"'tis the best badge of authority to an insolent boor."
</p>

<p>
"But the auld buckie, though round as a puncheon, of
Rhenish, can handle backsword and dagger, double and single
falchions like any French sword-player; and look ye,
Mr. Fenton, though a bare blade passed well enough in the Low
Countries under Condé, or in the west under Claver'se, it will
not do at all within sound of the Iron Kirk bell."
</p>

<p>
"Right, Halbert; we have neither law nor reason for
browbeating the poor vintner; but faith, our living so long at
free quarters has imparted to us a somewhat imperious mode
of requiring service at all hands.  Get the coach as you may,
Hab, but be speedy."
</p>

<p>
"And Hab, my son," cried Elsie with anxiety, "keep the
middle o' the gate till ye come to the place o' the Highrigs;
and gif ye hear aught like the bummel o' a wee drum amang the
lang grass or fauld-dykes by the wayside, neither quicken nor
slacken your pace."
</p>

<p>
"For remember," added Lady Grizel, "it is equally unlucky
either to meet or to avoid fairies or evil spirits."
</p>

<p>
"This cowes the gowan!" exclaimed Hab with a laugh,
which awe for the old dame failed to restrain.  "Lady
Bruntisfield, a lad that hath heard Dunbarton's drums beating
the point of war in the face of the Imperialists, need not
care a brass bodle for all the fairies and witches in braid
Scotland, and Gude kens, but there is plenty o' them&mdash;young
anes, at least&mdash;eh, cousin Meinie?" and suddenly kissing her
red cheek, he made a sweeping salute to the others, and sprang
from the cottage.
</p>

<p>
Elsie now remembered that in her alternate joy and anxiety,
the usual hospitality had been quite forgotten.  Her nappy
stone jars of usquebaugh and brown ale, with their attendant
quaighs&mdash;crystal being then a luxury for the great and
wealthy alone&mdash;cheese and bannocks of barley-meal were
produced, and each person drank the health of all the rest with
an air of solemn formality.  The strong waters were tasted
first for form-sake, and then their horns were replenished with
the dun beverage of October, while their stools were all
drawn close to the blazing fire, Lady Grizel, in the leathern
chair, occupying the centre.  Every face beamed with the purest
happiness, and none more than that of Walter Fenton, and
his handsome dark features, shaded by his clustering hair,
glowing in the light of the fire and radiant with joy, formed
an agreeable contrast to the paler and more interesting Lilian,
whose eyes beamed with vivacity and drollery.  Even old
Elsie's face became dimpled with smiles, and she whispered in
Meinie's ear, that "her auld een had never seen a mair
winsome pair" than Walter and Lilian.  Low as the whisper
was, it reached the ear of the latter, or she divined its
meaning, and it covered her with the most beautiful confusion,
for to a young girl, there is nothing so indescribably
charming, as when first her name is linked with that of a
lover.
</p>

<p>
Though very happy, they were very silent.  Lady Grizel
was sunk in reverie; Lilian was a little abashed, and Walter,
who was turning over his thoughts for a subject to converse
on, was becoming more perplexed, until relieved by Elsie's
loquacity, which found an ample theme in the terrors of the
famous gnome or fairy boy, whose appearance about that time
had caused no small consternation in Edinburgh.  On the
summit of the Calton&mdash;as all the gossips of the city were at
any time ready to aver on oath&mdash;he was heard at midnight
beating the role to the fairies, who came forth from under the
long dewy blades of glittering dog-grass or heavy docken-leaves,
from crannies in the rocks, and mole-tracks in the turf,
to dance merrily on the Martyr's rock, in the blaze of the
silvery moon.  And, worse still, this same devilish gnome,
by the clatter of his infernal drum, summoned weekly from
the four quarters of heaven, the gyre-carlins and witches to
Satan's periodical <i>levée</i>, and often the benighted citizen as he
wended up the long and dreary loan from Leith (to which
the ruins of a monastery, and a gibbet hung with skeletons,
lent additional terrors), paused in dismay, when the din of the
enchanted drum rang from the dark rocks on the gusts of the
midnight wind, and the troop of gathering hags astride
broom-sticks and sprigs from a gallows-tree, swept like a storm
through the air, bending strong trees to the earth, laying flat
the ripening corn, and rumbling among chimney-heads,
making the nervous indwellers cower under the bed-clothes,
and tremble in the wooden recesses of their snug box-beds,
while they murmured old charms against sorcery and the
devil.  Other witches of more aquatic propensities, were ferried
across Firth and Bay in eggshells, sieves, and
milk-bowies, to that damnable conclave, where
plots were laid to blast their neighbours' kail or
cattle, and work all manner of mischief, as the
Records of Justiciary show.  On all these
appalling facts, Lady Grisel and Elsie descanted with
such earnest seriousness, that Walter felt half
inclined to shiver with the rest, when the wind
rumbled in the chimney as if a flock of
gyre-carlins were sweeping past it, to their <i>levée</i> on
the Calton, about the bluff black rocks of which
Lady Grisel averred emphatically, she had
repeatedly seen them swarming in the bright
moonlight, like gnats in the summer sunshine; and
after evidence so conclusive, we hope nobody will
doubt it.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which my fond soul has uncontrolled pursued,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not turn aside from my least pleasure,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though all thy force were armed to bar my way.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;N. HOWE.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The evening of the night described in the
preceding chapter had been a glorious one.  The
giant shadows of the rock-built city were falling
from its central hill far to the eastward, and all its
myriad casements were gleaming in the light of
the western sky, where amid clouds of crimson,
edged with gold, the sun's bright disc seemed to
rest on the dark and wooded ridge of the Corstorphine
hills, from whence it poured its dazzling
flood of farewell radiance on all the undulations
of the wide and varied scenery.  On the vast
and dusky mass of the hoary city which presented
all the extremes of strong light, and deep retiring
shadow, on the great stone crown of St. Giles,
on the cordon of towers that girt the castled rock,
and the stagnant lake that washed the city's base
two hundred feet below, fell full the blood-red
lustre of the setting sun.
</p>

<p>
The same warm tints glared along the western
slopes of those bluff craigs and hills that rise to
the westward, green, silent, stern, and pillared
with basalt, rent by volcanic throes into chasms
and gorges; where, though darkness was gathering,
the slanting sunbeams shot through, and gilded
objects far beyond.  The loch, the city's northern
barrier, usually so reedy and so stagnant, now
swollen to its utmost marge by recent rains, was
dotted by wild ducks and teals, that seemed
floating in liquid gold, and like a polished mirror
the water reflected its banks with singular
distinctness.  On one side appeared the inverted
city, where gable, tower, and bartizan shot up so
spectral, close, and dense, that it seemed like one
vast fairy castle; on the other, a lonely and grassy
bank dotted with whins, alder trees, weeping
willows, and grazing sheep, while the old square
tower of St. Cuthbert, rising above a clump of firs
at one end of the loch, was balanced by the
church of the Holy Trinity and its ancient orchard
at the other.
</p>

<p>
On the northern bank of this artificial sheet of
water flocks of crows were wheeling in circles among
the furrows, and following the slow-drawn plough;
and from the thatched cottages of St. Ninians,
that nestled close to the ruins of an ancient
convent, the smoke arose in long steady columns,
and unbroken by the faintest puff of wind soared
into the evening sky, and melted away into the
blue atmosphere.
</p>

<p>
The sun had set.
</p>

<p>
The last rays died away on the cathedral spire,
and Arthur's round volcanic cone; the last
wayfarer had been ferried across the loch, and had
disappeared over the opposite hill; successively
the seven barriers of the city were closed for the
night, and then the evening bell from the old
wooden spire of the Tron rang on the rising wind.
Though this evening had been a beautiful one,
and all the gayer denizens of the city had flocked
to the Lawnmarket and Castle Hill (then the only
and usual promenades), the tall feather and laced
mantle of Lord Clermistonlee had not been seen
there.
</p>

<p>
From the windows of his chamber-of-dais he
had long been surveying the view before described,
but in one feature of it alone he seemed most
interested.  It was, where to the westward above
the open fields named Halkerstoun's Crofts, he
saw the smokeless chimnies of his empty,
dismantled, and deserted mansion of Drumsheugh,
which for many a year had been abandoned to a
venerable colony of rooks and owls.  The broad
acres of fertile land that spread around it were now
no longer his.  Successively haugh, holm, farm,
and onsteading, mill, and field had passed away to
the possession of others, and of the noble estate
acquired by his ancestors, and which he had
gained as a dower with his fair cousin Alison,
nothing remained but the silent and dreary
mansion, which was fated soon (by his pressing
necessities) to pass into other hands.  To
Clermistonlee this was the leading feature of the
landscape, and long and fixedly he surveyed its square
stacks of dark old chimnies that rose above the
bare and leafless woods.
</p>

<p>
The expression of his face was fierce and
unsettled; his cheek was deeply flushed; but that
might be attributed to the briskness with which
he and his gossip Mersington had pushed the
tankard between them since dinner.  They were
both deep drinkers, and in the old Edinburgh
fashion it was no uncommon thing, for his
Lordship (when he gave a dinner party) to lock
the room door, and in presence of his guests send
the key flying through the barred window into
the Norloch, thereby intimating that there
could be no egress until the last of a long array
of flasks, which Juden mustered on the buffet,
was drained to the bottom; after which the door
was unhinged, and all the guests were carried
home by their servants in chairs or shoulder high.
</p>

<p>
One hand was thrust under the ample skirt of
his shag dressing-gown; the other drummed on
the window panes; but a stern expression gathered
on his broad and lofty brow, and sparkled in his
deep-set hazel eyes.
</p>

<p>
Mersington sat near the cheerful fire.  His
weazel-like visage was radiant at times with a
malicious smile, which briefly gave way for one of
sincere pleasure, each time he applied to his thin
and ever thirsty lips the tankard of burnt sack,
which his affectionate hand never quitted for a
moment.  His mighty senatorial wig&mdash;the badge
of his wisdom and power&mdash;hung on the chair-knob
behind him, and his bald pate shone like a
varnished ball in the evening twilight.  His pale
grey eyes wore their usual expression, by which it
was impossible to detect whether he was drunk or
sober; but they often wandered to a panel
opposite, where the following was chalked in a bold
irregular hand.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<i>His honor the Laird of Holsterlee bets the Right
Honourable Lord Clermistonlee</i> £10,000 <i>of gude Scots
monie payable at Whitsuntide&mdash;his mear Meg
against Fleur de Lysy or Royal Charles.  To be
run at Easter on the sandis of Leith, God willing.</i>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  CLERMISTONLEE.<br />
  HOLSTERLEE, Scots Guards.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Forsooth! you are a proper man to start from
the board, and turn your back on a guest thus,"
said Mersington.  "Whistle a bar o' that oure
again.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "There was a clocker, it dabbit at a man,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he dee'd wi' fear,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he dee'd wi' fear&mdash;&mdash;"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"he&mdash;he, it seems to gie you as mickle comfort
as the burnt sack."
</p>

<p>
"Perdition, man!" exclaimed the other, wheeling
so briskly round, that he startled his guest in
the act of taking another long deep draught.
"How can you jest with my distress?  I tell thee,
friend Mersington, if the lands of Bruntisfield and
the Wrytes, on which I have built my hopes,
slip through my fingers thus, I may yet come to
the husks and the swine-trough, like the prodigal of
old.  Behold my manor of Drumsheugh on the
brae yonder; for these ten years a puff of smoke
hath not curled from its chimneys; the moss is on
its hearths, and cobwebs obscure the gilding of
its galleries and chambers: the long grass waves
in the avenue as it doth in the stable-court, where
my good and careful father mustered eighty
troopers in jack and plate the night before
Dunbar was fought and won by Cromwell.  My
ancient tower of Clermiston is in the same
condition, and both are mortgaged to that prince of
scribes and scoundrels, Grasper, the Writer in
Mauchin's Close.  This match with Holsterlee,
too!  S'blood!  Juden says the mare is elfshotten,
and our best jockies opine that I can never win
against Holster's racers, which have won the city
purse these five years consecutively."
</p>

<p>
"As for the race&mdash;he, he! to be off wi' the
Laird, swear your mare hath been bewitched, and
burn some auld carlin in proof o't."
</p>

<p>
"D&mdash;nation!  I am a ruined and impoverished man!"
</p>

<p>
"He, he! the auld gossips of Blackfriars' Wynd
tell another story."
</p>

<p>
"What do they say?"
</p>

<p>
"That Clermistonlee can never come to want,
as his friend the de'il has given him a braw purse,
with moudieworts' feet on't, and sae lang as he
preserves it, he shall never lack siller."
</p>

<p>
"I wish to God he had! but where got ye this
precious information?"
</p>

<p>
"At the tea-board o' my Leddy Drumsturdy,
nae further gane than yesterday."
</p>

<p>
"Stuff and nonsense!"
</p>

<p>
"I hope sae, for just sic a purse brought the
learned Doctor Fian to stake in 1590.  I've read
the ditty against him&mdash;he, he! but to come to the
swine-trough, that would be an unco pity, you
have such a braw taste for getting up dinners and
suppers, that his grace the gourmand o' Lauderdale
was just naething to ye."
</p>

<p>
"Say rather Juden Stenton, my ground baillie,
major domo, squire of the body, and everything."
</p>

<p>
"Then your burnt sack is just perfection; but
alake! you now begin to see the end o' chambering,
dicing, drinking, racing, and wantonness.
And puir Alison Gifford&mdash;faith, you made her
tocher flee fast enough!'
</p>

<p>
"This admonitory tone becomes <i>thee</i> well!"
said Clermistonlee, with scornful emphasis; "and
truly, thou art like one of Job's comforters."
</p>

<p>
"He, he!" chuckled the senator, who had a
strange fancy for maliciously stinging his
companion.  "This is the end o' spending puir
Alison's money among horse-coupers, vintners,
panders, de'ils-buckies, and bona-robas&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Hold, Mersington!  I beg you will hear me
with gravity.  My good cousin and gossip, at
times I have found your advice of the first value.
You know how immensely fond I am of Lilian
Napier, and having been pretty fortunate with the
sex in my time (crush me! like What-is-his-name,
I might say, <i>Veni, vidi, vici</i>,) I made the little
minx an offer of marriage, and, would'st believe
it? she really had the impudence to reject me."
</p>

<p>
"A braw buckie like you, Randal?  For what?"
</p>

<p>
"Forsooth, only because I was a matter of some
twenty years older than herself."
</p>

<p>
"Pest upon the gypsy! but then there is that
plaguy entail&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Pshaw!  I could soon have that broken.
Lady Grisel hath the life-rent, and after her death
(which cannot be far off), and failing the captain,
the Lands go entire to Lilian.  Now her cousin,
this gay spark in the service of their Mightinesses,
the States-General, by his leaguing and intriguing
with that Dutch intromitter, Orange William and
our rascally recusants, hath made the entail
null&mdash;a dead letter&mdash;ha!"
</p>

<p>
"Faith, Randal, if you get your claws laid on
the Bruntisfield barony, the rents thereof will puff
your purse out brawly for a time.  But alake! it's
like a sieve that aye rins out&mdash;ever filling, but never
full.  Bethink ye, man, there is the auld mansion
having the right of dungeon, pit and dule-tree, wi'
the grange, mains, yards, orchards, stables, doo-cot,
bake and brewhouses pertaining thereunto (o'd
I've the haill inventory by heart).  The four merk
land o' auld extent named Nether Durdie bounded
by the Burghloch&mdash;the fishings o' that water, the
rigs, rowme and holm o' Drumdryan, wi' the
farm-toun to the eastward thereof holden o' the
city for ane crown-bowl o' punch yearly, and ane
armed man's service, and whilk payeth 57 bolls
o' wheat, twa firlots o' barley, forty and aught o'
aitmeal, 64 gude fat capons, and sae forth&mdash;my
certie! by twa women being relaxit frae the horn
you have lost a' that, and deil kens how mickle
mair."
</p>

<p>
"Fool&mdash;fool! this croaking maddens me!"
exclaimed Clermistonlee, starting a second time from
the table, and pacing about the room.
</p>

<p>
"Come&mdash;come, my Lord," said Mersington,
putting on his wig; "he&mdash;he! ye may huff and
hector at Juden as ye please, but these are hard
words for a Swinton to swallow."
</p>

<p>
"I crave your pardon, gossip, but why torture
me thus?  I must have some signal and terrible
revenge on Dunbarton for his interfering with me
in this matter.  Could we not bring him under
suspicion of the Council?"
</p>

<p>
"A moral and physical impossibility."
</p>

<p>
"Juden would give him the contents of a
carbine if I gave him a hint anent it."
</p>

<p>
"It would be wiser to let him alone.  You
would have his chief, the Marquis of Douglas, and
every one of the name on ye like a nest o' hornets,
for they are a proud and thrawart race, that winna
thole steering.  Ye maun train your hawks at
other lures.  Od's fish, man! his mad musqueteers
would sack and slaughter the haill city."
</p>

<p>
"And Fenton!" continued the Lord, grinding
his teeth, "I would travel to Jericho to have him
within reach of my rapier&mdash;I would, d&mdash;n me&mdash;to
pull his nose off!  What a ravelled hesp is my
fortune!  My wounded hand, too&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Hee, hee! how can you expect it to heal,
when the haill blude in your body is turning into
burnt sack and sugared brandy?"
</p>

<p>
"It has kept me from prosecuting this affair.
But I am getting desperate, Mersington; between
love of the girl, lack of her lands, and fear of
poverty, nothing now can save me but a dash."
</p>

<p>
"Spoken like yoursel&mdash;like the wild Randal
Clermont o' 1670.  But what do ye propose?"
</p>

<p>
"To carry off Lilian and make a Highland
wedding of it&mdash;ha, ha!"
</p>

<p>
"Hee, hee! abduction, reif, and felony, anent
whilk see the acts of the seventh parliament of
James V. and James VI.  Parliament twenty-first,
chapter fourth&mdash;hee, hee! these would bear
hard on your case, my birkie."
</p>

<p>
"Pshaw! am not I, too, a Lord of the Parliament? so,
friend Mersington, reserve this musty
jargon for the Hall of the Tolbooth.  How often
hath a Scottish baron with his band ridden to
its threshold with jack and spear, and while his
trumpets blew defiance at the Cross, laughed the
fulminations of the three estates to scorn!"
</p>

<p>
"Ye mean mad Bothwell, with his thousand
spears; but Clermistonlee, wi' his man Juden,
would cut a sorry figure riding up the gate on the
same errand."
</p>

<p>
"But the mere abduction of a girl?"
</p>

<p>
"It canna be sae bad in law, as abducting that
dour auld carle, Durie the Lord President, whom
a mosstrooping loon, by orders o' Traquair, carried
off bodily, across his saddlebow, frae the dreary
Figget whins, and warded for sax calendar months
in the vault o' a Border peel.  For my part, I
have hated the name o' womankind since my Lady
Mersington had me fined a thousand merks Scots,
for that damned conventicle whilk, in my absence,
she held on my lands.  But Gude be thanked, I
had my vengeance, by having her banished the
liberties of the city, for hearing that Recusant
runion Ichabod Bummel preach, whilk rid me and
a' Bess Wynd o' her eternal clack.  Faith,
Clermistonlee, ye are welcome to abduct <i>her</i>, gif ye
please, he, he!"
</p>

<p>
"I thank you, gossip, but beg to decline," said
Clermistonlee, draining his tankard of sack; "but
to show thee, most learned senator, the value and
veneration I bear those acts you have just cited,
I shall this very night carry off Lilian Napier,
whom, my spies inform me to be concealed
somewhere to the south of the town.  O, by all the
devils, I'll easily find the place.  My blood's up;
I will make my fortune to-night, or mar it for
ever."
</p>

<p>
His sallow cheek glowed, his dark eye
flashed, and taking a very handsome pair of
pistols from the mantelpiece, he began to load
them with great deliberation having previously
summoned his faithful rascal Juden, by furiously
ringing a handbell.
</p>

<p>
"What's in the wind now, my Lord?" he asked,
rubbing his eyes, having been abruptly summoned
from an afternoon nap.
</p>

<p>
"You will learn ere long," said his lord with a
sternness that made the bluff butler's eyes to
dilate with surprise; "but see that you are as
prompt to act as to ask questions.  You must
bear a message from me to the Place."
</p>

<p>
"Eh? to Drumsheugh&mdash;at this time?"
</p>

<p>
"To Beatrix Gilruth."
</p>

<p>
"My Lord&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;" stammered Juden.
</p>

<p>
"Saddle a horse, ride round the loch, and tell
her that the young lass she wots of will be there
to-night, and that she must have some of the old
rooms in the north wing, those that overlook the
rocks, prepared for her reception."
</p>

<p>
"Where the gipsy was put, that we harled awa
frae the west country?"
</p>

<p>
"What, the wench whom Holsterlee took off
my hands, the same.  You stare oddly&mdash;dost hear
me fellow&mdash;art thou sober?"
</p>

<p>
"As a judge, my Lord."
</p>

<p>
"Then hear me and obey.  Desire this hag,
Beatrix, to have all prepared for my fair one's
reception&mdash;fires lit and tapestry brushed, and, on
peril of thine own life, be speedy and secret.
Tarry neither there nor by the way, as I will
want thee when the town drum beats at ten
o'clock."
</p>

<p>
"She's an uncanny body, Lucky Gilruth,
though I mind the time when there was not a
bonnier lass in a' the Lowdens," said Juden,
scratching his rough chin with undisguised
perplexity; "but now, the auld wrinkled hizzie, she
deserves the tar barrel as weel as lucky Elshendder."
</p>

<p>
"What the devil is all this to me?"
</p>

<p>
"It is a lonesome and eerie road across Halkerstoun's
crofts by the lang gate, and on such an
errand to such a woman, with the mirk night
coming on&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Blockhead! thou hast been guzzling in the
wine cellar.  Begone, or I will beat thee; but
first have the mare saddled as well as the horse,
and procure a good link, and fail not when the
drum beats.  I will ride the Duke, 'tis a strong
old trooper, and used to carrying double&mdash;hah!
Away, away, and on peril of thy life, speak of
this to no man."
</p>

<p>
"You will find me as of auld, Clermistonlee,
a hawk of the right nest."
</p>

<p>
"Look well to Meg's girths."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, my Lord, a fidging mear should be weel
girded&mdash;now then hoe! for the Place."
</p>

<p>
Juden drained a wine cup that his master
handed him, and in five minutes more, the mare's
hoofs rang on the causeway of the steep wynd,
and died away as he descended into the deep
gorge; under Neil's Craigs, wheeled through the
Beggar's Row, and ascended the opposite bank.

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Clermistonlee was well aware that the forcible
abduction of a young lady of family (or
quality, according to the phraseology of the time),
would create no small degree of indignation
against him; but confiding in his rank, and in
the influence of the powerful faction to which he
belonged; aware that never could he otherwise
obtain possession of Lilian's person, and
ultimately her property, goaded by dread of poverty
rather than avarice, inflamed by his own wild
fancies and irregular passions rather than by love,
and spurred on by the taunts and advices of the
half cunning and wholly malicious Mersington,
he sat longing with the utmost eagerness for the
time of action, the tuck of the ten o'clock drum,
after the beating of which, all within the city walls
usually became so silent and still.  He knew also
that the family of Napier had experienced a
severe shock by their recent forfeiture, and a
squadron of Dalyel's dragoons being quartered
on their estate for three weeks past, and being
yet under hiding (as the term was), the abduction
of Lilian could be more easily executed; and if
once within the barred doors and grated windows
of his desolate mansion on the rocks at Drumsheugh,
or the massive chambers of his still more
lonely tower on Clermiston Lee, Lilian might bid
farewell equally to mercy and to hope.
</p>

<p>
Aware of the lonely situation of Elsie's cottage
on the verge of the great Burghmuir, fully two
Scottish miles from the city cross, and knowing that
the locality was always deserted after dusk, in
consequence of the unsettled nature of the times, and
a horde of footpads who infested the remnants
of its forest and the deep quarries and moss-haggs
through which the roadway wound, and which,
independent of a gibbet, a ruined church and
graveyard, deterred all and sundry, after the city
gates were closed, from travelling that way after
dusk&mdash;considering all those things, the noble roué
had no doubt of being able to fire the little
cottage, and, in the confusion, to bear away Lilian
across his saddle-bow.  And to cast suspicion in
another quarter, he had desired Juden to have a
bonnet or two, a grey maud and a bible, to leave
on the road close by, that the odium of the
outrage might fall on the houseless Cameronians
who lurked among the hills to the southward.
</p>

<p>
Tipsy as he was, when the time approached for
Clermistonlee setting forth, Lord Mersington had
still sense remaining to say,
</p>

<p>
"Tak' tent, Randal, my man&mdash;hee, hee!&mdash;bide
ye a wee, ere worse come o't.  You may bring
king, council and parliament about your lugs for
this, and the Foulis o' Ravelstone, Congaltoun o'
that ilk, and Merchiston himsel will swarm like
a hornet's nest, and 'Horse and spear!' will be
the cry through half the country side&mdash;he, he!'
</p>

<p>
"Curses on thy everlasting chuckle!" muttered
the other between his teeth, as with fierce
impatience he thrust his brass-barrelled pistols
into his embroidered girdle.  "What the devil
are Ravelstone or Congaltoun to me?  If the
worst comes, 'tis but flying to the west highlands till
the affair blows over.  I can count kindred with
some of the best who bear the name of Campbell."
</p>

<p>
"Kindred that will truss ye wi' a tow, and
hand ye over for twenty merks to the first macer
or corporal of horse that the Chancellor sends
after you.  Remember how Assynt served
Montrose thirty-eight years ago?"
</p>

<p>
"Your suspicions wrong my highland
kinsmen, who are honourable men&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But true blue whigamores withal&mdash;hee, hee! and
brawly you'll look coming up the Netherbow
in a cart like Montrose, puir fellow! wi' the town
halberds bristling round ye, and Pate Pincer wi'
his axe maybe, and our noble friend Perth sitting
in the Lower Chamber wi' his finger on the acts
of James the Vth and VIth, anent wilful
fire-raising&mdash;hee, hee! and as for the lassie&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"My Lord, this is intolerable stuff!" said
Clermistonlee, shrugging his shoulders; "you cannot
be so young a politician as not to perceive that a
storm is approaching, which will crush and
confound together all the factions that now distract
the land, and keep our swords for ever by our
sides.  All men see it&mdash;else whence this muster
of troops and din of preparation on both sides of
the Border."
</p>

<p>
"Storm&mdash;a storm said ye?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, amid which, if we can hold our own
bonnets on our heads, we will be clever fellows,
Swinton."
</p>

<p>
"And whence blows the breeze, think ye?"
</p>

<p>
"'The Lowlands of Holland,' as the song
says," replied the cavalier lord, drawing himself
up with a scornful smile.
</p>

<p>
"Wheesht!&mdash;hee, hee, hee!" chuckled the
other, waving one hand warningly, while burying
his rat-like visage in the sack tankard to hide the
cunning smile of intelligence that spread over it.
"Harkee, Randal, whare'er the de'il be laird,
you'll be tenant&mdash;hee, hee!'
</p>

<p>
"I value a crash in politics at the worth of a
brass tester, and bid hail to the days of hard
blows and buff coats.  Ha! ha!  I may pick up a
marquisate in the scramble," laughed Clermistonlee,
flapping his hat over his eyes.  "You will
not accompany me to-night, being scarcely
cavalier enough for this kind of work."
</p>

<p>
"Hoots, man, a double-gowned senator of the
College of Justice, a Lord of Council and Session,
aiding and abetting in wilful fire-raising!  Doth
not the act say, 'Quha cummis and burnis folk
in their housis will be guilty o' treason and
lese-majestie?' and as for running off wi' the lassie
Lilian, that is clearly a kidnapping o' the lieges,
whilk, according to Skene and Sir Thomas o'
Glendoick&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Gossip Mersington, there are overmuch wine
and law in thee to-night to leave room for
common sense.  Ha! there goes the ten o'clock drum,
and that loitering villain has not yet returned!"
</p>

<p>
He threw open a window that faced the south,
where the black mansions of the Netherbow
towered up from the steep hill at the foot of which
his house was situated.  The sound of a distant
drum, beat in slow, regular, and monotonous
measure, was heard on the wind at intervals, as a
drummer of the Civic Guard (an old corps of
Scottish gensd'armes, which existed from the
fatal day at Flodden until 1818,) ascended
St. Mary's Wynd, his usual nightly round, after
having descended the Bow, and beat along the once
lordly and fashionable Cowgate, where kings have
feasted royally, and where Scottish nobles and
the ambassadors of foreign powers were wont to
dwell&mdash;but now the hideous abode of misery and
crime, and long since abandoned to the dregs of
mankind.  On strode the drummer, and the gates
of the Netherbow revolved back at his approach:
as he passed under its double towers, its
picturesque spire and high embattled arch, the great
street of the city, wide and lofty, but dark and
deserted, rang to the same monotonous chamade
and all its echoing closes, broad paved wynds and
old arcades of wood or stone, its circular stairs
and oaken outshots gave back a thousand
reverberations as "the ten o'clock drummer" strode
on, until reaching the Town Guard House, where
he finished his perambulation of the ancient
Royalty by a long and loud ruffle, which scared the
vultures from the skulls that mouldered on the
parapets of the prison, startled the rooks in the
gothic diadem of St. Giles, and made all its
hollow vaults and high arched aisles, where the
dead of ages lie, give back the warlike sound.
</p>

<p>
The drum rang loudly as it passed the archway
that led to the lodging of Clermistonlee, who
threw down the window with a crash, exclaiming,
</p>

<p>
"Malediction on my messenger&mdash;I must mount
and ride without him.  Hah! here comes the
loitering rascal in time to save his shoulders from
a stout truncheoning."
</p>

<p>
A horse's hoofs rang in the courtyard; Juden's
heavy boots clattered on the pavement as he
dismounted and ascended to the chamber-of-dais,
puffing, panting, and looking very pale and
disconcerted.
</p>

<p>
"So-so, fellow," said the irritated lord, "it has
pleased you to return at last."
</p>

<p>
"With God's providence, my Lord."
</p>

<p>
"How, fool?  What means this unwonted
piety?  Art drunk, fellow?"
</p>

<p>
"Fie, Juden!" said Mersington, "a fou-man'
and a fasting horse, should hae come faster home
hee, hee!"
</p>

<p>
"You saw this woman, Gilruth, and left my
message, I presume:"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, my Lord, yes," gasped Juden.
</p>

<p>
"What the devil is all this?  There is
something wrong with thee, Juden."
</p>

<p>
"Then to be plain wi' your Lordship, I canna
thole the auld Place after nightfa'?  I aye think
o'&mdash;think o'&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What?" asked Clermistonlee, furiously.
</p>

<p>
"O' puir Leddy Alison," whined Juden, half
in sorrow, and half in spite.  "Eh, sirs! but the
auld Place o' Drumsheugh is fu' o' her memory,
and I seemed to hear her sweet low voice in every
sough o' the auld aik trees, and to see her shadow
in every glint their branches threw on the
moonlighted avenue and auld grey house."
</p>

<p>
"Fool, fool," said Clermistonlee in a subdued
voice, "you speak as if she had been murdered."
</p>

<p>
"Nor did she fare mickle better," muttered
Juden, under breath, however.
</p>

<p>
"Poor Alison!&mdash;so gentle and unreproaching,"
said the lord in a low musing voice, "Alison&mdash;once
that name was ever on my lips&mdash;her presence was
ever with me, and her idea raised a rapture in this
hollow heart, to which it has since been a stranger.
Yes, my love was a very true one."
</p>

<p>
"While it lasted," said Mersington.
</p>

<p>
"Of course," rejoined the other, recovering
himself.  "I loved her to distraction once; or
thought so, and by all the devils, 'tis quite the
same thing.  She is dead now, and peace be with
her; but peril of thy life, Juden Stenton, trouble
me no more with such untimely elegies.  And
pray, Master Morality, how have you dared to
loiter away these two hours past?"
</p>

<p>
"Ask that elfshotten Mear Meg?" said the
butler, testily.  "Either the cantrips o' Beatrix
Gilruth, or Lucky Elshender (baith o' whom are
weel deserving o' the branks and tar barrel,
Mersington), hae clean bewitched that puir beast.
May I never lay head on a pillow to-night, if I
wasna' spell-bound on Halkerston's Crofts, where
I continued to ride and spur, wi' the black Calton
looming in front and St. Cuthbert's kirk behind!
but I never neared the one, or got further from
the other; and yet Meg was fleeing like the wind,
or as fast as ever she did for city purse or king's
plate on the sands o' Leith.  The night was dark:
a cauld wind swept owre the crofts, and soughed
among the kirkyard yews and lang nettles by the
drystane dykes; red lights gleamed in the runnels
that bummel down the brae side, and redder stars
were shooting in the lift.  A cauld perspiration
burst owre me, every hair bristled under my
bannet&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Rascal&mdash;art mocking us?"
</p>

<p>
"Patience, my Lord," groaned poor Juden.
"I kent there was a spell on me, and I tried to
say some holy word or name; but, as the deil
would hae'd, the sounds aye stuck in my throat;
and there I sat, sweating and trembling, and
spurring a galloping nag that never progressed;
and there indubitably I must hae been until
cockcrow, if I hadna&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What?" exclaimed his master, stamping with
impatience.
</p>

<p>
"Made a grasp at a rowan tree that grew near,
and pu'ed a bunch o' the last year's berries, when
lo! the charm was broken, and Meg shot awa
like the wind&mdash;and I cleared the lang gate as if
the Paip and the Deil were behind me."
</p>

<p>
"And dost think, rascal, that I believe one
word of this precious Tale of a Tub, foisted up to
deceive me, for time spent in the village
change-house yonder!  Ha, knave! remember the old
saw&mdash;Good wine makes a bad head and a long
story."
</p>

<p>
"My Lord, as I left the place, auld Gilruth
cried, 'A safe ride to ye, Juden,' and her eldritch
laugh is yet dingling in my lugs."
</p>

<p>
"That makes it a clear case o' withcraft,"
mumbled Mersington, who was now very tipsy.  "He-he!&mdash;we'll
hae the carlin before us in the morning,
Juden.  Ay, my Lords (macers, silence in court!),
this is as clear a case o' witchcraft as ever came
before us&mdash;and the Act under Queen Mary (puir
woman) anent sorcery bears just upon it.  Your
Lordships will remember," continued the senator,
who thought himself on the bench, "the cases o'
Isabel Eliot and Marion Campbell, twa notorious
witches, who, for renouncing their baptism, and
dancing a jig wi' the deil, were burnt at the Cross
wi' ten others in the September o' seventy-eight,
for whilk see the Record o' Justiciary&mdash;hee-hee,
a braw bleeze!"
</p>

<p>
"I will show a blaze on the Burghmuir to-night
worth a dozen of it&mdash;ha, ha!" laughed Clermistonlee,
as he drew on his voluminous boot-tops of
stamped maroquin with silver bosses.
</p>

<p>
"O'd, Clermistonlee, do ye really mean to burn
Elshender's cottage?" asked Juden with delight.
</p>

<p>
"Yea, sink me! from rigging-tree to
ground-stone."  Juden rubbed his hands.
</p>

<p>
"If the auld witch is bed-ridden," said he, "it
will save the Provost a bundle o' tar-barrels, forbye
a pock o' peats."
</p>

<p>
"And perhaps cure those spells which you think
the hag hath cast upon my best nag?  And so,
Mersington, you will not ride with us to-night?"
</p>

<p>
"No, by my faith!"
</p>

<p>
"Then your learned Lordship forgets one
notable point of our old Scottish law, by which a
guest becomes the bounden ally of his host."
</p>

<p>
"True; but only if loons come against him wi'
harness on&mdash;boden in effeir o' weir, as the Acts
have it."
</p>

<p>
"As the chase after Lilian may be a hot one,
omit not to spread most industriously that I am
gone to the west, to England, to the devil, or any
where, to put them off the right scent&mdash;ha, ha! while
I am luxuriating in the smiles of Venus in
the recesses of my snug old house over the hill
there.  Dost hear me?  By Jove, he's very drunk.
Fetch me a tass of brandy and burnt sugar,
Juden."
</p>

<p>
It was brought immediately, in one of those long
glasses then made at the citadel of Leith.  It set
Clermistonlee's impatient blood on fire.
</p>

<p>
"Another for thyself, Juden, and then to horse,
and away.  Your servant, gossip Mersington: if
unfortunate, you will see me in the course of
to-morrow; if otherwise, the devil knows when.
Marriage and hanging go by destiny&mdash;so do all
other things&mdash;with a hey lilleu and a how lo lan."
</p>

<p>
"Aye-aye, awa ye neer-do-well&mdash;ye deil's
buckie&mdash;I'll stay and keep the terrier company.  The
sack is glorious&mdash;the English port auld as the
mirk Monanday a' sixteen hunder and fifty-twa&mdash;a-clear
case o' sorcery, your Lordship&mdash;o' dark
dealing wi' the great enemy o' mankind&mdash;hee-hee!&mdash;and
woman kind baith."
</p>

<p>
His head sank forward on his wine-bespattered
cravat, and the senior senator of the College of
Justice fell fast asleep.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII.
<br /><br />
CLERMISTONLEE MAKES A SAD MISTAKE.
</h3>

<p class="intro">
But if this young lady will marry you, and relieve us, O my
conscience!  I'll turn friend to the sex, and rail no more at
matrimony.&mdash;THE LYING VALET.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Issuing from a private gate in the northern
flank of the city wall, at the foot of the court
attached to his mansion, the Lord and his staunch
follower mounted in a narrow lane, overhung on
one side by gloomy trees, and on the other by the
ancient hospital of the Holy Trinity.  The great
oriel, or triple window of its church was then
faintly lighted by the beams of the rising moon,
the silver disk of which seemed to rest on the
sable ridge of Arthur's Seat.  They passed through
the Calton, then a straggling burgh, consisting of
antique houses of Flemish aspect, but occupied
by a very inferior class of citizens, and entered
the long and solitary path called Leith Loan,
which was formed by an ancient trench of the Great
Civil Wars; hollowly rang their horses' hoofs
between the black rocks of the Calton on one
hand, and the steep bank of St. Ninian on the
other, where the ivied and shattered walls of a
convent presented in the bright moonlight a
striking variety of light and shade.
</p>

<p>
To avoid every chance of recognition or surprise,
Clermistonlee thus made a complete circuit
of the city, leaving it on the side opposite to the
scene of his operations.  The night soon became
as cloudy and dark as he could have wished it, for,
as the fitful moon became involved in opaque
masses of vapour, every object was rendered
obscure and indistinct.  On one side of the way
lay the lake, like a sheet of ink, and beyond it
rose up the stupendous cliffs and ramparts of the
castle, and the gigantic outline of the city
towering like a mighty bank of cloud, through which
the lights of distant casements glimmered like far
and fitful stars.  On the other side spread open
fields and solitary farms; the castles of the Touris
of Inverleith, the Kincaids of Warriston, and two
or three small and lonely hamlets.
</p>

<p>
"Clermistonlee," began Juden, closing up to
his master as the Long Gate became darker and
more lonely, for the cottages of St. Ninian were
now far behind; "If the auld witch, Elshender,
by kecking through a spule bane should divine
our errand, our riding will be to little purpose
I reckon.  She is an unco uncanny body, Lucky
Elsie, and though her gudeman was a trooper,
and did richt leal service in King Charles' wars,
I would fain see her brought to the tar-barrel, for,
wow, but I hate an auld blench-lippit, long-chaffit,
sunk-eyed carlin, as I do sour ale or the deil."
</p>

<p>
The Lord vouchsafed no reply to these sapient
remarks, and Juden, feeling somewhat uneasy at
his silence, the darkness, and their vicinity to the
old Cross-kirk of St. Cuthbert, with its great
square central tower and broad burial grounds,
studded with mossy tombstones and slabs half
sunk in the long reedy grass, spurred nearer and
spoke again.
</p>

<p>
"And then to think o' Meg, puir beastie! to
fa' ill o' the wheezlock, the malanders, and deil
kens a' what, the very night ye trampled down
that auld cummer's kailcastocks, and wi' this match
wi' Holsterlee to come off at Easter!  Troth, my
Lord Mersington has thumbscrewed and tar-barrelled
scores o' auld besoms on the half o' sic
evidence o' malice, and ungodly ill will.  And I
would beg o' you to gie Mersington a hint, that
she was the gossip of Helen of Peaston, who was
burned ten years byegone.  Od's fish!  I saw the
brodder o' the High Court run his steel pricker
thrice into Belzeebub's mark on her bare back&mdash;a
lang black teat whereat she suckled Hornie's
imps, and she neither winced nor skirled.  And
for what I would like mickle to ken&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Silence."
</p>

<p>
"Doth not this auld deevil, Elshender, deserve
the tar-barrel as weel as her neighbour
cummer."
</p>

<p>
"I tell thee, silence!  Blow the match that
must light the link."
</p>

<p>
"The link&mdash;now?"
</p>

<p>
"Thou hast it I hope, pumpkin-head?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;yes, my Lord&mdash;but wow I wish this
desperate job weel oure."
</p>

<p>
"Art getting white-livered?  Is this our first
affair of the kind?"
</p>

<p>
"What, if the coach with the skeleton Lady
cam' rumbling up Leith loan after us!  It is
about her hour noo.  Burn my beard, if I wadna
die o' sheer fright."
</p>

<p>
"Would to Heaven she came then, and rid me
of a thorough household pest."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, ay, but ye would sune find the want o'
puir auld Juden.  Wha would spice the Canary
and Rochelle, mull the sack and sugar the brandy
like me?  Wha then would doctor your nags,
break your hounds, and train your hawks wi' leash
and lure, and do everything ye can think o', frae
birselling a crail capon to backing a troop-horse,
and frae brushing your spurleathers, to being your
staunch henchman on sic a hillicate errand as this?
Hech, Sir!  I am picking up my thanks now for
standing by ye wi' buff and bilbo on many a
stormy day, fighting now for the kirk and then
for the king&mdash;a bab o' blue ribbons in my bonnet
to-day, a cavalier's white feather the morn, just as
it suited you to uphold one banner because the
other was like to be beaten down."
</p>

<p>
"Rascal! let these be the last of those
impertinent reflections which you permit yourself to
make on my conduct.  Recollect that as my
bounden vassal, my will is thine, my word thy
law&mdash;enough&mdash;and seek not as usual, old
Mr. pertinacity, to have the last word with me."
</p>

<p>
"I am mum, my Lord." Juden checked his
horse and fell to the rear in high dudgeon.
</p>

<p>
Making a complete circuit of the suburbs, they
crossed the Burghmuir, where the turrets of
Bruntisfield rose above the dark oaks of the olden
time.  Clermistonlee took a long survey of the
stately old mansion and its domain, and greatly
refreshed with the noble aspect thereof, pushed
on with increased speed.
</p>

<p>
When they approached the little cottage it was
dark and silent as the ruined chapel beside it, and
the beechen grove which overshadowed them both.
The smoke of the rested night fire curled up pale
and grey among the dark copsewood, from the
massive clay-built chimney, but there was no
other sign of life within.  Concealing their horses
behind a thick privet hedge, the conspirators
approached the cottage, Clermistonlee unrolling
an ample rocquelaure of scarlet cloth to throw
over Lilian as a muffler, the moment she rushed
forth to escape the conflagration.
</p>

<p>
"The hut is very still," said the Lord.
"Zounds! if she should be gone away."
</p>

<p>
"Impossible," responded Juden.  "Jock, my
sister's son, watched the place until mirk night
came on.  But hear me&mdash;one word, my Lord, ere
we come to the onset?"
</p>

<p>
"What the deuce is it now, thou most
incorrigible prater?"
</p>

<p>
"Would it no be better to ding up the door
and carry the lady off before I fire the bit placie,
lest the flame bring those who might strike in to
the rescue?"
</p>

<p>
"True, Juden, you speak sensibly for once,"
replied his master, who staggered a little in
consequence of his recent potations, and felt no
ordinary excitement as the moment approached, when
he hoped to clasp Lilian Napier in his arms, and
bear her off in triumph.  Clermistonlee had long
been the wildest gallant of his time, and in such
a desperate affair as this he felt quite in his
element.
</p>

<p>
Poising a large stone aloft, he hurled it against
the door with all the impetus he could lend it;
but the barrier yielded not.  An exclamation, half
smothered in the depths of a box-bed, showed that
the inmates were sufficiently alarmed by the
thundering shock, and poor Elsie lay quaking under
the bed-clothes, in full conviction that the devil
and his elvish drummer to boot, were about to
force an entrance.  Again and again Lord
Clermistonlee hurled it against the cottage door; but
it remained fast as a rock, for several strong bars
of wood inserted in the massive wall, gave it all
that security which was then as necessary to the
hut as to the palace.  Juden raised aloft the
flaring link, and its light streamed by fits on the
thatched roof and whitewashed walls, on the divot
seat in front, with woodbine and wild rose-tree
clambering above it; on the high beech trees that
spread their arms to the night wind, scaring the
rooks from their leafless nests, and the sparrows
from the thick warm thatch which the blazing
link menaced every instant.
</p>

<p>
"Reif and roist the obstinate yett!" exclaimed
Juden, capering as the stone rolled back upon his
shins, and Clermistonlee, exasperated by the
unlooked-for delay, furiously thrust the link into the
heavy thatch.  The dense mass smouldered and
smoked for an instant, while the dry straw below
struggled with the thick stratum of green moss
above, till the former prevailed, and a broad lurid
flame shot upward, revealing the broad fields and
pasture land, the rough dykes and budding
hedgerows, the dreary road that wound over the
adjacent hills, the far recesses of the beechen grove,
bringing forward the knotted branches and gnarled
and ivied trunks in strong relief, from the
darkness and obscurity of the wooded vista behind.
Full on the roofless walls and pointed windows of
St. Rocque fell the fitful light, and on the spacious
burial ground, where close and thick lay the
headstones of those unfortunates who perished in the
deadly pestilence of 1645.  In a few minutes a
mass of blazing thatch fell inwards through the
bared and scorched rafters, and a terrific scream
ascended from within.  Fire now flashed through
the little square windows of the cottage, and its
whole interior became filled with yellow light;
but the door still remained fast, while the shrieks
that rang within made Clermistonlee tremble with
apprehension.
</p>

<p>
"Fury and confusion!" he exclaimed, "she may
be scorched to death by that flaming mass of thatch!
Horror! aid me&mdash;fool and villain&mdash;to burst in the
door! quick, or the accursed Baillie of the Portsburgh
with his trainband of souters and wabsters
will be on us."
</p>

<p>
While he was speaking, the cottage door flew
open, and, amid a shower of sparks, which she
threw from her attire, a female rushed forth in a
slate of distraction.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis she, Juden!" cried Clermistonlee, "'tis
she!  I could know that purple hood among a
thousand!" and rushing forward with a tipsy
shout of triumph and rapture, he snatched up the
the slight figure, over which his staunch bravo
threw the ample and stifling rocquelaure in a
manner that showed he had practised it on former
occasions, as it effectually prevented her cries from
being heard.  Tall, strong, and muscular,
Clermistonlee with perfect ease placed his fair captive
on the croupe of his horse, and, springing into
the saddle, gave it the spur so suddenly, that it
bounded into the air, and he lost a stirrup.
</p>

<p>
"Courage, Juden!" he exclaimed, while his
heart panted with love and exultation; "to horse
and spur for the Place of Drumsheugh&mdash;but first
assist me&mdash;confusion!  I have lost a stirrup&mdash;quick,
varlet, the curb-rein.  So, now, look to thy
petronel, for, by Jove!  I hear a horn blowing
somewhere."
</p>

<p>
Trembling with terror, and shaken furiously by
the bounding of his restless horse, the muffled
captive lay helpless in his bold embrace.  One
hand and arm were firmly clasped round her
light and shrinking figure, the other held the
reins of his powerful horse, which dashed along
the road, clearing dyke and hedge at a bound,
until gaining the summit of the Burghmuir, where
the road was rendered dangerous by the ancient
quarries, moss-haggs, and heron-shaws that
bordered it.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Lilian, why will you struggle with
me when I tell that your efforts are vain; but
fear not, gentle one, I will slacken my horse's
speed if you wish it."  He spoke with the utmost
deliberation and coolness; for he was too much
used to such affairs to feel at all puzzled in making
an apology; besides, he was very tipsy.  "You
have long rejected me, dear Lilian, and forced me
to this act, for which I crave your pardon with the
most abject humility&mdash;by all the devils I do!  I
am not one to stand on trifles, as thou knowest:
no, sink me! and if it is in the power of man to
bend a woman's will to his, thine shall bend to
mine."
</p>

<p>
This address was in no way calculated to quiet
the terrors of his prisoner: his lordship was
becoming more and more confused and intoxicated,
as every bound of his horse forced into his head
the fumes of the wine of which he had partaken so
freely; and so he continued in the same strain&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"What dost say, little one&mdash;my beloved Lilian
I mean&mdash;you will struggle, you will scream?
Permit me to insinuate, my dear Madam, that it
will be worse than useless, for nothing can avail
you now but pleasing me; a course I would advise
you to pursue forthwith.  I know some devilish
fine women that would be proud to do it&mdash;crush
me if I do not!  My dearest Lilian, (what was
I saying?) I will teach thee to love as I would
wish to be loved.  My heart and coronet are at
your feet&mdash;will not sincere love beget love?  By
all the devils, I know it will!  You will pardon
all this to-morrow, for I know women forgive all
that has love for an excuse; then how much more
so you, that are ever so gentle and kind, when
other dames are so haughty and cold; d&mdash;n
them! amen.  You think me a wicked ruffian,
eh?  Zounds!  I am not at all so, but a very fine
fellow in every respect, though an unfortunate
victim of love to thee and fear of a few rascally
creditors.  My pretty Lilian, in fact I love thee
so tremendously, that even the pen of Scuderi
could never describe it; and I swear by this kiss,
dear Lilian, and this&mdash;and this&mdash;a thousand furies!
where am I?"
</p>

<p>
He became sobered in a moment, for, on removing
the mantle to salute the soft cheek of the
girl, instead of beholding, as he expected, the head
of a seraph peeping forth from a mass of bright
ringlets, lo! a ray of the sickly moon streamed
on the hooked nose, peaked chin, grey haired,
and smoke-begrimed visage of Elsie Elshender.
</p>

<p>
"Horror!" exclaimed Clermistonlee, whose
rhapsody this terrible vision had cut short.
</p>

<p>
"Avaunt, hag of hell!" and, trembling in every
fibre with rage and disgust, he flung the poor
woman from his arms, and goading his horse with
the sharp rowels, dashed up the dark and rough
Kirk Brae at a break-neck pace; while Juden,
totally unable to comprehend what had taken
place in front, partly drew up as the female rolled
by the way-side, near the gate of the Place of
Bruntisfield.
</p>

<p>
"Awa wi' ye! fie and out upon ye, ye sons o'
the scarlet woman!" exclaimed Elsie in great
wrath and tribulation, for she soon recovered the
use of her tongue.  "May a' the plagues of Egypt
fa' upon your ungodly heads!  May the Lord
send cursing vexation and rebuke!  Out upon ye! fie,
and a murrain upon ye!"
</p>

<p>
Juden was astonished; but no sooner did he
hear her shrill voice, and behold by the moonlight
her aged and withered visage, with long tangled
hair falling grey around it, than he became seized
with a superstitious terror, which the raising of
her long skinny arm and crooked finger, as if to
curse, completed; and he stayed not to hear the
expected anathema.
</p>

<p>
"The first fuff o' a haggis is aye the hottest,
but I'll not bide a second.  Tak' that, ye accursed
witch, until you are tarbarrelled!" he exclaimed,
and fired his long horse pistol full in her face.
Poor Elsie fell forward motionless, while Juden,
without daring once to look behind him, dashed
at full gallop after his lord, who had already
crossed Halkerston's Crofts, and was nearing the
village of St. Ninian.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hollyhock are found.<br />
  An instant on her form I gazed,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So delicately white;<br />
  Mild as a tender lamb was she,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as the red rose bright.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LAYS OF THE MINNESINGERS.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It is, perhaps, unnecessary to inform the reader
that, thanks to the delay caused by Juden's cunning
or superstition, Lord Clermistonlee's intended
seizure of Lilian Napier had been attempted an
hour too late.  This was indeed fortunate.  Had
it been made earlier, blood and blows and loss of
life must have undoubtedly ensued.
</p>

<p>
Exactly one hour before the unexpected visit
which ended in the destruction of Elsie's cottage,
and nearly terrifying the poor woman out of her
senses, her late guests had all departed in one of
those vast and solemn hackney equipages (before
described) which crawled away over the Burgh
muir like the mighty catafalco of a deceased hero,
past the end of the still and waveless Burghloch,
and up the dark and gloomy avenue of Bruntisfield,
after being nearly an hour in traversing, a space
which any modern cab will carry one over in three
minutes.  Like a true gallant of the day, Walter
Fenton stood on the footboard behind, while Hab
with his matchlock slung, shared the driver's
ample hammer-cloth, so that the ladies and their
attendant Meinie (whose delight and wonder at
being in such a vehicle must be duly commemorated)
were pretty safe from those bold lads of the
post who prowled about after nightfall with sword
and pistol, making every unarmed citizen who
chanced to pass that way, stand and deliver cloak
and purse with so cavalier an air, that it was
almost impossible to refuse.
</p>

<p>
With as much formality as if she was entering
a conquered city, Lady Grizel received the keys
of the barbican gate from her ground-baillie Syme,
of the Greenhill, who, bareheaded, with three
stout sons, bearing torches, and several of the old
servants who had found shelter in Syme's onsteading,
and whose clamorous joy burst forth in loud
pæans of triumph, as she was led by the baillie into
the old baronial chamber of dais, the canopy of
which, to the simple "tenant bodies" of those
days, was fraught with more terrors than the
chair of the Lord President Lockhart.
</p>

<p>
"A thousand welcomes to your Ladyship," said
Symon, bowing profoundly for the twentieth time.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, Symon," replied Lady Bruntisfield,
giving him her hand to kiss.  "I hope your gude
wife is well, and that your youngest bairn got over
its hooping cough by the means I prescribed."
</p>

<p>
"My lady, wi' the advice o' a barber-chirurgeon&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"A barber-guse! did I not tell ye to pass
that afflicted bairn three times through a blackberry
bush, whilk is an infallible remedy&mdash;but I'll
see after it mysel to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
Lilian wept and laughed, and gave her hands
to the servants to kiss, for her heart beat as
joyously to find herself under the old ancestral roof,
as if she had doubled Cape Horn since she last
saw it.  She kissed grand-aunt Grizel, and rushed
from one dark and silent apartment to another, as
if to gladden them by her happy presence, and
looked forth with beaming eyes on the waving
woods and the long expanse of the placid lake,
whose dark bosom gave back the light of a
thousand stars, and anon she paused to listen to that
old familiar sound, the cawing of the rooks amid
those great hereditary oaks, the remnants of the
vast forest of Drumsheugh, which, in the days of
St. David, surrounded the city and its castle on
every side.
</p>

<p>
Meantime, standing under the old velvet canopy,
and leaning on her walking-cane, Lady Grizel was
listening with a kindling eye and glowing cheek to
her ground-baillie, who poured forth a dismal and
exaggerated report of the extortions and outrages
committed on her tenantry by Capt. Crichton's
troop of the Grey Dragoons, who had carried off
all the baillie's own grain, "whilk he had laid up
for seed; they had taken the best cow, and a notable
nowte from the gudeman of Netherdurdie, and
nae less than three bonnie servitor lassies frae the
farmtoun of Drumdryan; they had toomed every
corn-ark, meal-girnel, and beer-barrel in the
barony, forby and attour, extorting riding-money
three times owre wi' cockit carbines!"  It was a
lamentable story, and three energetic taps from
the Lady Grizel's cane closed the tale.
</p>

<p>
She, however, found her own mansion scatheless,
save where several drawers and lock-fast
places had been forced and damaged during the
search of Macer Maclutchy and other underlings
in authority, for treasonable papers (and more
especially loose cash), while in the cellars an
empty runlet or two, and empty flasks in such
number that Drouthy the butler surveyed them in
silence for ten minutes before he began to swear
and count them&mdash;bore evidence of the strict search
which Sergeant Wemyss and his musqueteers had
prosecuted in the lower regions of the house.  The
news of their lady's return spread to the Home-grange
and neighbouring cottages like wildfire, and,
half dressed, the good people came crowding to the
mansion testifying by repeated acclamations their
joy at her return and restoration to rank; for, save
the honoured, envied (and, from that moment,
hated) Elsie Elshender, none knew where she had
been concealed for the past month.  It was
generally thought that she had fled to England, to the
"Lowlands of Holland," or some other "far awa
place."  The affection which the Scottish tenantry
ever manifested for the old families on whose lands
they dwelled, whose banner their ancestors had
followed, with whose name and fame, and hope,
and happiness, or misfortune, their own were so
interwoven, and under the wing of whose protection
so many generations of their race had lived
and died, was a noble sentiment of the purest
love peculiar to the nation.  It knit together
in a manner which we cannot now conceive, the
interests of the highest and the lowest&mdash;a remnant
of the good old patriarchal times, which strongly
marked the character of the people, and, like the
endearing ties of clanship, was very different from
the feudal tyranny that existed in other lands.
</p>

<p>
Late though the hour, the old house was crowded
with glad faces; casks of ale were set abroach by
Mr. Drouthy, and every ruddy cheek became
flushed with joy and the brown October beverage;
every eye was bright and moist; a buzz of happiness
pervaded the spacious mansion, and rang in
the dark woods around it.  But midnight passed;
the morning waxed apace, and now the baillie
rang the household bell, as a warning for all to
retire, and, making an obeisance, bonnet in hand,
he set the example by trotting away on his plump
Galloway cob.
</p>

<p>
Walter Fenton, as he had no excuse, (though every
wish,) to stay, would have retired with the rest; but
this Lady Grizel's hospitality would by no means
permit; he remained without much pressing, and
after the parting or sleeping cup had been passed
round, they separated for the night, and Walter,
in the same apartment which had witnessed his
combat with Captain Napier, lay down on his
couch, not to sleep, but to brood over bright and
joyous visions of the future that were never to be
realised.  One moment his heart glowed with
unalloyed rapture and unclouded hope; and the next
he was half despairing when he compared his
humble fortune with that of Lilian.  His whole
inheritance was military service: of his family he
knew nothing but their name.  He was a child of
war and misfortune; and these, more than he
could foresee, were to be his companions through
life.  He was poor and obscure; while Lilian, with
her artless beauty and girlish sweetness of
manner, inherited the name and blood of one of the
oldest and proudest houses in the Lowlands&mdash;barons
to whom the Prestons of Gourton, the
Kincaids of Warriston, and the Toweris of that
ilk, were but mushroom citizens; and when he
pictured the grey old mansion which sheltered him,
so tall, so grim, and aristocratic in aspect and
association, and the many acres of fertile field, of grassy
pasture, and bosky wood that stretched around it,
and weighed in the balance his half-pike......
</p>

<p>
Lovers are the most able of all self-tormentors.
His horizon became fearfully overcast, and his bright
visions seemed to end in smoke, till hope came again
to his aid.  Poor Walter! he was now fairly in
love, and for the first time; his heart was
unhackneyed in the ways of the world, and he knew not
that the time might come when, with an inward
smile, he would wonder that he ever thought so.
But between his own anxious fears, the cawing of
the rooks and creaking of the turret vanes, grey
morning began to brighten the far off east before
he slept.
</p>

<p>
With the first blush of dawn, old Elspat
Elshender arrived with a confused but lamentable
history of the disasters and terrors of the night&mdash;of
how she had been carried away by the devil
and Major Weir on a high trotting horse&mdash;how
claps of thunder had rung around her cottage, and
lightning consumed it&mdash;and that it was not until
she was able to repeat the Lord's Prayer that they
assumed the forms of Lord Clermistonlee and his
hellicate butler, Juden Stenton, and thereafter
vanished in a flash of fire, leaving Elsie among
the nettles and whins at the avenue gate.
</p>

<p>
Lady Bruntisfield, who, seated in her arm-chair,
cane in hand, had listened to this wonderful
narrative with great gravity, was at no loss to
attribute the enterprise to the proper personages, and
though the indignation she felt was very great,
her alarm and uneasiness were greater.  She now
saw to what lengths the passion and daring of
this rash and profligate suitor might carry him.
In consequence of his rank and power, (which the
complaints of a hundred old women could never
shake,) it was deemed expedient to commit the
affair to silence, but to be on their guard, and in
future never to go abroad without an armed
escort&mdash;composed of old Syme the baillie and his sons,
or some such stout fellows, with sword and pistol.
Meantime, the burning of the cottage (a loss
which Elsie deeply mourned, for there she had
dwelt a wife and widow for more than forty
years,) was attributed by some to the outcast
Cameronians who lurked among the whins of Braid,
and by others to certain malicious spunkies who
then inhabited the morasses to the westward.
</p>

<p>
At a late hour next morning Walter awoke.  It
was now the month of April.  The sun shone
warmly from a bright blue sky streaked with
fleecy clouds that gleamed like masses of gilded
snow, as his radiance streamed aslant between
them.  The grass and the budding trees were
heavy with dew, and the merry birds were
chirruping and hopping from branch to branch, as if
their little hearts rejoiced at the approach of
summer.  The ravenous gled and the ominous
rook were soaring on their dark wings into the
azure sky, and their light shadows floated over
the still bosom of the loch, scaring the lonely
heron that waded in its waters, till piercing up,
and farther up they grew mere specks in the
welkin, as they flew towards the rising sun.  The
old mansion, with its tall smoky chimneys and
projecting turrets, gleamed cheerily in the red
sunlight that streamed down the long shady
avenue, where myriads of gad-flies wheeled and
revolved in the golden beams as they pierced and
shot through the thickening foliage&mdash;thickening
and expanding under the warm showers and
warmer sun of April, the balmy month of fresh
leaves and opening flowers, of fleecy clouds and
bright blue skies.
</p>

<p>
The beauty of the spring morning, and the
passages of the preceding night, made Walter feel
joyous and gay.  At his toilet he took more than
usual care in folding his cravat of point lace,
hooking his coat, of tight and spotless buff, with
its bars of silver lace, and in twisting his smart
moustachios.  His thick dark locks escaped from
under a bonnet of blue velvet, adorned with the
cross of St. Andrew and a single white feather.
His breeches were of red regimental cloth, and
his stockings of scarlet silk.  A gorget of bright
steel, and a long basket-hilted rapier, suspended
by a buff shoulder-belt, were his only arms, and
he was altogether a handsome and gallant-looking
fellow.  With a light step, and a lighter heart,
he followed the servant, who ushered him into
the chamber of dais, where Lilian arose from
tinkling on the spinnet, and running towards him
with that delightful frankness which made her so
charming, bade him good morning.
</p>

<p>
For the first time since they were children, he
found himself alone with her, and the young man
felt seriously embarrassed.  Lilian seemed so
fresh, rosy, and beautiful, the touch of her hand
was so gentle and graceful, and the purity of her
complexion so dazzling, (exhibiting just enough
of red to shew perfect health,) that she might
have passed for the goddess of the season.  The
richness and neatness of her dress did full justice
to her round and charming person; a well busked
boddice and stomacher of black taffeta, edged
round the fair and budding bosom with a deep
tucker of rich lace, and short sleeves frilled with
deep falls of the same revealed her round and
spotless arm, from the dimpled elbow to the
slender waist.  Her bright glossy hair (Meinie
had found her very difficult to please in its
arrangement that morning) rolled over her
shoulders in massive tresses, perfumed, and tied with
a white ribbon, which drew them back from her
delicate temples and beautiful ears.  A carcanet of
Scottish pearls&mdash;those found of old on the rocks
of Orrock&mdash;encircled her neck, and a long sweeping
skirt of black satin gave a stateliness to her
air, which with the admirable contour of her nose
and short upper lip, by their noble yet piquant
expression, completed.  Her blue eyes were
beaming with delight, and a half blush played
about her cheek as she glided towards Walter
Fenton.
</p>

<p>
"My dear old friend," said she, after the usual
compliments, "I hope you slept well in this poor
house of ours, notwithstanding the ghosts that
make it their special business to plague all
visitors; but after the turmoil of last night, I can
hardly doubt it."
</p>

<p>
"The redness of your cheek, gentle Lilian,
shows me that you must have slumbered soundly,
and have quite recovered the terrors of the last
few weeks."
</p>

<p>
"O no, I scarcely slept at all, or did so only
to dream I was still at poor Elsie's, hiding in the
meal girnel.  My head is buzzing still with the
clamour of the tenantry (are they not all dear
folks?) and old Syme of the Hill, with his doleful
catalogue of enormities, stoutrief and hamesucken
committed by the troopers; and then poor old
Elsie with her mishaps!  Ah, good Heavens! if
it was really the devil that ran off with her!  But
were not the poor vassals happy last night?  O
I could have kissed every one of them; and I am
so happy, Mr. Fenton, to find myself under this
dear old roof again, that I could dance with glee
if you would join me.  But you, who were so
kind when greater friends shunned and forgot us,
you who have endured so much contumely for
our sake, how can we ever recompense or thank you?"
</p>

<p>
"By ceasing to remember it as an obligation.
O rather view it as a duty!" said Walter, in a
low voice.  "Madam Lilian, often ere this, I have
by intentional remissness of duty, saved many an
unfortunate from the dungeon and the cord.  But
they were poor Recusant Cameronians whose
escape was valued as little as their lives.
</p>

<p>
"As nurse Elsie says, these are indeed fearful
times," replied Lilian, laughing; "but truly, when
I remember the kind and gentle little Walter I
used to play with long ago, I think you must be
much too tender hearted for soldiering."
</p>

<p>
"Under favour, Lilian," said Walter, feeling
his heart flutter as she spoke, "a true soldier is
ever compassionate; and the hand that strikes
down a foe should be the first to succour and
protect him when fallen.  I am too well aware
that in these days of religious persecution and
political misrule, the Scottish soldier is often,
too often indeed, the instrument&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Hush, friend Walter! art not afraid I will
betray thee?  Have you forgotten that horrid
vault, the Tolbooth, and its grim Gudeman?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, the rascally clown, I have a crow to
pluck with him yet; but I was only about to say,
that in these days of ours&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, you are about to speak treason again,"
said she playfully.  "I mean to be very loyal, and
must not permit you, although there are none
here who would betray you, unless it be the old
corbies that croak on the chimney head.  But
come with me, and I will show you their nests in
some strange places, I promise you; and I have
flowers to visit, and my pigeons too, poor pets!
I once thought never to behold them again.
Come, Mr. Fenton, your hand; how beautiful the
morning is!"
</p>

<p>
Charmed with her vivacity, Walter became
every moment more delighted with Lilian Napier.
With a very cavalier-like air which he had
acquired among his Parisian comrades of the
Musqueteers, who had returned from the French to
the Scottish service only ten years before, he
hastened to give her his ungloved hand, and they
sallied forth into the garden, where the deep rows
of Dutch boxwood that edged the walks, the
leaden statues of satyrs, swains, and shepherdesses,
the gravelled terraces and flights of steps, the old
mossy sun and moon dial, and the fantastic
arbours, were all in admirable keeping with the
quaint old manor house that towered above them.
Old John Leekie, the gardener, clad in his coarse
sky-blue coat, and long ribbed galligaskins,
reverently doffed his broad bonnet, and bowed
his lyart head, as his young mistress passed, and
patting his shoulder with her hand, bade him a
"good morning."  The old man's eye brightened
as he surveyed the garb and bearing of Walter
Fenton, and continued his occupation of hoeing
up the early kail, with a sigh;
</p>

<p>
  "For he thought of the days that were long since by,<br />
  When his limbs were strong, and his courage was high:"&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p>
and when he rode in the iron squadrons of the
loyal Hamilton and stern Leslie.
</p>

<p>
"Gentle Lilian," said Walter, colouring deeply
as he gazed on the fine old mansion, the walls of
which were quite encrusted with coats armorial
and quaint legends, "it is when surveying so
noble a dwelling as this that I feel most bitterly
how hardly fortune has dealt with me."
</p>

<p>
"Tush, friend! hast never got the better of
those old glooms and fancies yet?  Read the
motto over yonder window; ah! 'tis my dressing-room
that," said the lively girl, pointing to a
distich in Saxon characters, which was one of the
many that adorned the edifice.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Quhen Adam delved and Eve spanne,<br />
  Quhair war a' the gentlis than?"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"It is very true; but I, who am a soldier, cannot
think of those things like a philosopher."
</p>

<p>
"Then do not think of them at all."
</p>

<p>
"How numerous are the coats and quarterings
here! there is the eagle of the Ramsays, the
unicorns of the Prestons, and the saltier of Napier."
</p>

<p>
"But, Mr. Walter, do you know that Aunt
Grizel asserts there is an ancient prophecy which
says, that like the Scottish crown, the fortune of
our house came with a lass, and will go with one."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed!" rejoined Walter, considerably
interested, "its fortune?"
</p>

<p>
"That is&mdash;you must understand&mdash;you know
that," and here poor Lilian became seriously
embarrassed, "that it came to the Napiers by
marriage from the Wrytes, and by marriage it
will go to others."
</p>

<p>
Walter's heart fluttered; he was about to say
something, but the words died on his lips, and
there ensued a silence of some minutes; Lilian,
who sometimes became very reserved, being
abashed by what she had said, and Walter stupidly
pondering over it.  Lilian was the first to
speak.
</p>

<p>
"See you that old corbie on the branch of the
dale tree, that horrid branch, all notched by the
ropes of old executions?"
</p>

<p>
"He with the bald head now watching us?"
</p>

<p>
"The same: what think you Aunt Grizel says?
He saw my great grandsire and his train in all
their harness, ride down the avenue when they
marched with brave King James to Flodden."
</p>

<p>
"By that reckoning he must be&mdash;let me see&mdash;one
hundred and seventy-five years old."
</p>

<p>
"O, there are some older than that hereabouts;
but come to the dovecot, and there we shall see
birds of brighter plumes and better augury than
these gloomy corbies."
</p>

<p>
As they approached the dovecot, a round edifice
vaulted and domed with stone in the most
ancient Scottish fashion, a tame pigeon winged its
way from amid the scores that clustered on the
roof, and after fluttering for a time over Lilian's
head, alighted on her shoulder and nestled in her
neck, rubbing its smooth and glossy head against
her soft cheek, and even permitting Walter to
stroke its shining pinions, which in the sunlight
varied alternately from green to purple, and from
purple to red and gold.  On each leg it had a
silver varvel with Lilian's cypher on it.  As
Walter caressed the beautiful bird, his hand often
touched the soft cheek and softer tresses of the
happy and thoughtless girl.
</p>

<p>
"How properly this gentle emblem of innocence
and happiness greets you as its mistress."
</p>

<p>
"And am I not its proper mistress?" asked
Lilian artlessly.  "It is the bird of peace, too."
</p>

<p>
"And love&mdash;so that it well becomes the hand
of beauty."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! you are beginning to be waggish now.
It is just so that your friend Douglas of Finland&mdash;he
with the flaunting feathers&mdash;addresses my
gay gossip, Annie Laurie.  You know Annie?
She is considered the first beauty in the Lothians,
and 'tis said (but that is a great secret, and you
must not say I said so) that the young lairds of
Craigdarroch and Finland are going to fight a
solemn duel about her.  She is much taller than me."
</p>

<p>
"Then she is too tall for my taste."
</p>

<p>
"Oh! but I am quite little; you used to call
me little Madam Lily once.  But her hair is the
most beautiful brown."
</p>

<p>
"I prefer," said Walter, taking up one of
Lilian's heavy tresses, "I prefer the colour that
approaches to gold."
</p>

<p>
"And her eyes are just like mine."
</p>

<p>
"They must be beautiful indeed."
</p>

<p>
"Ha, ha!" laughed the merry girl: "harkee,
Mr. Fenton, did I not know positively to the
contrary, I would think you had been in France."
</p>

<p>
"Wherefore, Madam?"
</p>

<p>
"Because," said she, roguishly, with half-closed
eyes, "you twist all one's speeches into compliments
so readily and bluntly, and so quite unlike
our douce Scots' gallants (who always let slip the
opportunity while they are making up their minds),
that you quite remind me of Monsieur Minuette,
who came here with the Duke of York.  Ah, you
remember him, with his long sword&mdash;how like a
grasshopper on a pin he looked; and he tried
stoutly with his frightful rigadoon and the bretagne,
to put our good old Scottish dances into the shade,
and so out of fashion.  And yet Aunt Grizel says
that, to see the Lady Anne (she that is now
princess of Denmark), so tall and stately, and
Claverhouse, so graceful and courtly, dancing the
Italian vault-step, enraptured every body.  O, it
it was quite a sight.&mdash;But there jangles the
house-bell, and now let us hie to breakfast."
</p>

<p>
Once more she placed her hand in Walter's,
and they returned to the chamber of dais, where
Lady Bruntisfield, no longer disguised in the
humble attire of a cottar, but in all her pristine
splendour of perfumed brocade, and starched
magnificence of point lace and puffed locks frizzled
up like a tower on her stately head, welcomed
Walter with a courtesy of King Charles the First's
days, and kissed her grandniece.
</p>

<p>
After a long and solemn grace, the repast
began.  The most substantial breakfast of these
degenerate days would dwindle into insignificance
when compared with that which loaded the long
oaken table of Bruntisfield House.  In the centre
smoked a vast urn of coffee, surrounded by
diminutive cups of dark-blue china, flanked on the
right by a side of mutton roasted, on the left by
a gigantic capon; a dish of wild ducks balanced
another of trout, both being furnished by the
adjacent loch; broiled haddocks, pickled salmon,
kippered herrings, pyramids of eggs, and piles of
oat and barley-cakes; wheaten loaves and crystal
cups of honey were also there; but chief above
all towered a vast tankard of spiced ale; beside it
stood a long-necked bottle of strong waters to
whet the appetite, lest through the eyes it should
fairly become satisfied by the mere sight of so
many edibles.
</p>

<p>
At the lower end of the board, the servants
were accommodated with bickers and cogues of
porridge and milk, which they supped with
cutty-spoons of black horn, while two mighty trenchers
of polished pewter held the magazines from which
they drew their supplies.  The custom of domestics
sitting at the same table with their superiors
was then almost obsolete; but Lady Grizel, whose
memories and prejudices went back to the days of
King James VI., still retained the ancient fashion,
and consequently all her household sat down with
her, save two old serving-men in green livery,
with her crest on their sleeves: these were in
attendance each as an <i>écuyer tranchant</i>, or cutting
squire.  On the party being joined by the ground
bailie, Syme of the Greenhill, who, in consequence
of his being a bonnet-laird, was permitted
to sit above the salt, the important business of
making breakfast proceeded with all the gravity
and attention such a noble display deserved.
Cheerful and good-humoured, though punctilious
to excess, like every noble matron of her time,
Lady Grizel Napier did the honours of the feast
with that peculiar grace which makes a guest feel
so much at home.  She never once recurred to
late events, but conversed affably on the topics of
the day, like Lilian, investing little trifles with an
air of interest that made them quite new and
charming to Walter; for though aged and failing
fast, she still possessed that art so agreeable in a
well-bred woman, that even when she talked nonsense,
one could scarcely have thought it so; and
certainly, when witches, spells, and ghosts were the
theme, the wise and gentle King James himself
was nothing to her in credulity.
</p>

<p>
"Symon, I hope ye obeyed my injunctions to
the letter, in the affair o' your bairn's
hooping-cough," said the old lady, who took an active
hand in all the family matters of her vassalage.
</p>

<p>
"Faith did I, my Lady, but found the wee
thing no' a hair the better of it.  It is an unco
trouble, the cough, but Lucky Elshender says, gif
I put my forefinger down the bairn's throat for
fifteen minutes, it will never cough mair."
</p>

<p>
"I'll warrant it o' that," said the old lady,
scornfully; "but how dare she prescribe for any
bairn on the barony without consulting me?  I'll
gang o'er in the gloaming and see about it."
</p>

<p>
"Mony thanks to your Ladyship."
</p>

<p>
An air or two on the virginals, and Lady Anne
Bothwell's touching <i>Lament</i> performed at full
length by Lilian in her sweetest manner concluded
the visit, and Walter reluctantly prepared to
retire.  Lady Bruntisfield and Lilian departed in
their sedans with two armed servants before and
two behind them, to pay a most ceremonious visit
of thanks to Lord Dunbarton and his beautiful
Countess, and Fenton, after accompanying them
to the arch of the Bristo Port, left them to the
care of their retinue, and receiving a warm
invitation to visit them soon again, pursued his way
in a maze of stirring thoughts through the steep

CHAPTER XIX.
<br /><br />
THE OLD SCOTTISH SERVICE.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  The soul which ne'er hath felt a genial ray<br />
  Glow to the drum's long roll or trumpet's bray;<br />
  Start to the bugle's distant blast, and hail<br />
  Its buxom greetings on the morning gale&mdash;<br />
  <i>Such</i> the muse courts not.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD GRENVILLE.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
On the return of Walter Fenton to the White
Horse Cellar, Douglas, who was lounging on the
broad flight of steps in front of the edifice, and
chatting gaily with a buxom damsel of the
establishment, informed him that Holsterlee of the
Life Guards had just been there, saying that the
Earl of Dunbarton and the Lords of the Privy
Council required his attendance at the Lower
Chamber&mdash;immediate attendance.
</p>

<p>
His mind became troubled at this information:
though unconscious of having done anything
new to incur displeasure, it was with considerable
anxiety he bent his steps to the precincts of
that dreaded tribunal.
</p>

<p>
The Lairds of Craigdarroch and Holsterlee, (or
as the latter was commonly called, Jack Holster,)
two of Claverhouse's cavalier troopers lounged in
the antechamber smoking their Dutch pipes, while
the yeomen of the Scottish Guard in their blue
bonnets and scarlet doublets, armed with long
daggers and gilt partisans, thronged the
Parliament Close and outer lobby of the house.
</p>

<p>
Their presence in some degree lessened his
anxiety, as the absence of the military police of the
city, and the viler menials of the law, announced
that matters of state, and not of inquisitorial
persecution were before that powerful and
extraordinary conclave.  He waited long in the
well-known antechamber, whose features brought back
a host of gloomy thoughts, amid which his mind
wandered continually to the house of Bruntisfield;
but he endeavoured to mingle in the gay conversation
of the two guardsmen, who talked nonsense
as glibly and laughed as loudly as if they had
been in Hugh Blair's tavern on the opposite
side of the square, instead of being within earshot
of those whose names were a terror to the land.
After all that was of importance to the state had
been discussed and dismissed, Walter, on being
summoned by the drawling and hated voice of
Maclutchy found himself before the same bench
of haughty councillors he had confronted a few
weeks before; but now its aspect was different;
the rays of the meridian sun streamed cheerfully
into their dusky place of meeting, and hangings
which appeared sable before were now seen to be
of crimson velvet, fringed and tasselled with gold,
gilded chairs, and the throne surmounted by the
royal arms with the gallant Lion in <i>defence</i>; the
rich and varied dresses of the Lords, massively
laced and jewelled with precious stones,
embroidered belts, and embossed sword-hilts, were
all sparkling in the several flakes of light that
gushed between the strong stanchells of the
ancient windows into the gloomy and vaulted
room.
</p>

<p>
The stern basilisk eye of Clermistonlee alone
was fixed on Walter as before.
</p>

<p>
The Lord High Treasurer, the Chancellor, and
the sleepy Mersington, withdrew as our hero
entered.  Near the head of the table stood the
Earl of Dunbarton in his rich military dress of
scarlet, with the cuffs slashed and buttoned up to
reveal the lawn sleeves below; his gallant breast
was sheathed in a corslet of polished steel,
beautifully inlaid with gold, and over it fell his lace
cravat and the sable curls of his heavy peruke.
His badge as Commander-in-chief of the Forces,
an ivory baton with silver thistles twined round it
was in one hand; the other rested on his plumed
head piece.  The magnificence of his attire formed
a strong contrast to that of the stern Dalyel, who
wore a plain suit of black armour like that of a
curiassier of Charles I., but rusted by blood and
perspiration, and defaced by sword cuts and
musquet balls, it was a panoply with which his
long silvery beard and iron, but dignified face
corresponded well.  Making a half military obeisance
to these Lords of Council, Walter, felt not a little
reassured by the presence of his patron the Earl
and Sir Thomas Dalyel.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Fenton," said the former, "we have
much pleasure in presenting you with that to
which your merits so much entitle you&mdash;a pair of
colours in my ancient regiment of Royal Scots,
vacant by the death of young Toweris of that
ilk, who has been slain in a late camisadoe in the
north, with some broken rascals of the
Clan-Donald.  You will therefore hear the king's
commission read over, and thereafter sign your
oath of fealty to us without delay, as the day is
wearing apace."  Taking up a small piece of
parchment to which appeared the Great Seal of
Scotland, the signatures of the King and
Secretary of State, and his (Dunbarton's) own seal
with the four quarters of Douglas, the Earl read
the following, which we give verbatim:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I George, Earl of Dunbarton, Lord of Douglas,
Knight, Baronet, and Knight of the Thistle,
Lieutenant-General, and Commander-in-chief of
the Scottish forces, by virtue of the power and
authority given to me by His Most Sacred Majesty
James VII., do hereby constitute you, Walter
Fenton, Gentleman, an Ensign of the Royall
Regiment of Ffoote in that companie wheroff his
Honor the Laird of Drumquhazel, Chevalier of
St. Michael, is captain.  You are therefore to
obey such orders as you may receive from His
Majesty and your superiors, as you expect to be
obeyed by your soldiers according to the Rules
and Discipline of War.
</p>

<p>
"Given under my hand and seal at the Bristo Port.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"DUNBARTON."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Though astonished at all this unusual
formality, Walter bowed in pleased and grateful
silence, and then he heard the stern voice of
Major-General Dalyel.
</p>

<p>
"Maister Fenton, you will please to repeat
after me, and sign your oath of Fealty to this
Council and the three estates of the realm."
</p>

<p>
"Oath of Fealty, Sir Thomas?" reiterated
Walter, equally surprised and offended at this
new proposal, which accompanied the
long-wished-for gift.  "My Lords, though deeply
grateful for this mark of your favour, I deplore
that you should suspect me&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Sir," interrupted Lord Clermistonlee, hastily
and haughtily, "at <i>present</i> we suspect you of
nothing; but the corruption of these times, when
the very air seems infected with treason and
disloyalty, have made an oath of fealty necessary
from this time forth."
</p>

<p>
"To the King?"
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;to the Officers of State and the Parliament
of Scotland&mdash;and woe unto those who shall
break it!  An Act of Council previous to one of
the House, made it law an hour ago.  Art
satisfied, sirrah?"
</p>

<p>
"My Lords, I like it not, for it implies a
suspicion a man of spirit cannot thole," replied
Walter, in an under tone, as he advanced to the
table; and Clermistonlee, seized by a sudden fit
of passion, was about to pour forth some of his
furious and abusive ebullitions, when Dunbarton
said mildly:
</p>

<p>
"Walter, an edict of council hath (as his Lordship
said) made this law, which will be more fully
confirmed by the three estates.  Mr. Secretary,
read aloud the oath of fealty, and the young
gentleman will sign it."
</p>

<p>
"By my beard, he had better, or prepare for
his auld quarters again," added Dalyel, sharply,
striking his heavy toledo on the floor.
</p>

<p>
Thus urged, Walter heard the oath of allegiance,
which the approaching crisis in the affairs of those
factions that then rent both Scotland and England,
rendered necessary for the security of the
Government&mdash;promising "faithfully to demean himself
to the estates of Scotland presently met;" and
affixed his name thereto, little foreseeing how dear
that oath was yet to cost him, and how unfortunate
in its influence it was, at a future time to prove
to his fortunes.  As if he foresaw it, a dark smile
lit the sinister eyes of Clermistonlee; it was a
peculiar scowl of deep and hidden meaning; and
though Walter soon forgot it at the time, he
remembered it in after years when the cold hand
of misfortune was crushing him to the dust.
</p>

<p>
"I trust, young birkie," said the fierce Dalyel
with a keen glance, "that you will never again
waver in the execution of your duty or military
devoir; but be stanch as a red Cossack, and ever
ready to do his Majesty gude and leal service
(<i>whatever be his creed</i>) against all false rebels and
damned psalm-singers, whilk are the same."
</p>

<p>
"I will gage my honour for him," said Dunbarton.
</p>

<p>
"How readily my Lord defends his loon,"
whispered Clermistonlee to Dalyel, but not so
low as to be unheard; and the Earl's cheek
flushed&mdash;his brows knit; but he made no reply,
save waving his hand to Walter, who withdrew.
</p>

<p>
The warm noonday sun streamed brightly down
the High-street; the musical bells of Saint Giles
jangled merrily in the pure breeze that swept
through the stone-arched spire; and Walter Fenton
never felt so happy and light of heart as when
he issued from the sombre Parliament-close into
the bustle of that grand thoroughfare; and giving
full reins to his fancy, allowed it to career into
regions fraught with the most brilliant visions of
the future: fame, fortune, happiness, all were
there in glowing colours, but were&mdash;never to be
realized.
</p>

<p>
Poor Walter!  That hour laid the foundation
of the airy palace of love, glory, and renown,
which every ardent young man builds unto himself,
and which indeed is the only fabric that costs
nothing but the bitter achings of a seared and
disappointed heart.  To Walter it was the dawn
of joy; his foot, he thought, was now firmly
planted on the first step of the dangerous ladder
of honour; and with his thoughts divided between
war, ambition, and Lilian Napier, and with his
heart glowing with exultation, he pulled forth the
little scrap of parchment to re-examine it again and
again, as he skipped down the crowded street, and
a severe concussion against a tower of the
Netherbow first roused him from his dreams.  He was
in excellent humour with himself, pleased with
everybody, and enraptured with the Lords of
Council, whose orders he was ready to obey in
everything, whether they were to storm a tower
or fire a clachan, march to England, or duck an
"auld wife" in the North Loch.
</p>

<p>
"My stars are propitious to me to-day," said
he aloud, as he half-danced down the street
towards the White Horse Cellar.  "O, may Heaven
give me but opportunities to win a name; and if
the most unflinching perseverance&mdash;the most
spotless loyalty&mdash;and a headlong valour, such as not
even Claver'se can surpass, will bring me honour
and renown, I feel that I <i>shall</i> win <i>them</i>.  O
Bravo for the roll of the drum! the rush of the
charging horse! and the ranks of pikemen
shoulder to shoulder!  I am one of the Guards of
St. Louis&mdash;King James's Scottish Musqueteers&mdash;the
old <i>Diehards</i> of Dunbarton."

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
